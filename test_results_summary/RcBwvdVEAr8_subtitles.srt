1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,790
Okay, hi, everybody, we're live here.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,850
Jeff, the prosperous from blessings on my journey.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,650
And it's an absolute honor to have Dr. Anthony Shafi.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,550
Good day, Dr. Shafi.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,090
Hey, thanks for having me, man.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,950
I'm good to see you.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,690
Yeah, you too.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,110
And I want to apologize to you to all your subscribers,

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,170
to my subscribers.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,930
I had huge technical difficulty this morning.

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,210
It's like eight, 45 now,

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,130
and we were supposed to start 45 minutes ago.

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,810
So I'm really sorry to everybody,

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,290
so I just want to start with that.

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,110
I just want to say, Dr. Shafi,

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,630
this is my fourth time on with you.

17
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,630
So I want to thank you again for making time for me.

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,370
I think, actually, to be honest with you, Dr. Shafi,

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,990
I think it's been about five times,

20
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,270
because if I include the 24 hour live event

21
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,930
we're a carry band showed my video and you addressed me.

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,370
That was the first time really.

23
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,790
And then we did one with carry.

24
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,030
We did one with you and me just recently.

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,510
It came out on your podcast.

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,470
And we did one with, I believe, JT from Polka Moonshine.

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,210
It was the one about youth in carnivore.

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,250
So we've done a few.

29
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,490
So thank you very much.

30
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:19,690
Yeah, no problem, man.

31
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,770
So it was a pleasure.

32
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,550
And it's always great to see you and carry everything

33
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,310
that you guys are doing and getting the word out there.

34
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,690
It's just growing and growing and growing.

35
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,570
And getting more people excited about it, which is great.

36
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,070
And my subscribers were all tuning in now.

37
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:35,850
They're all saying hi.

38
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,930
So thank you.

39
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,210
I just wanted to say to everybody that's tuned in.

40
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,090
I just want to introduce myself and Dr. Shafi's going

41
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,930
to introduce himself.

42
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,890
And I want to also introduce talk about us as athletes

43
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,530
our little history, just a brief one.

44
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,630
And then we'll start fielding questions kind of.

45
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,410
Is that sound good?

46
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,130
Dr. Shafi?

47
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,070
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.

48
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,230
OK, and I just want to do one quick thing,

49
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,830
because I kind of had this plan.

50
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,170
My two sons, Peter, and Dante, let me see here.

51
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,070
They were going to be on with us today,

52
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,390
because it's about athletes.

53
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,910
But anyone can see in the background there,

54
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,550
there is the footy pitch and Peter and Dante are on there

55
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,190
right now.

56
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,970
And they're training from 8 a.m. till 10 a.m.

57
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,510
Chaffee: And they do that every Saturday and Sunday,

58
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,910
Chaffee: with this trainer, Ian McClerg, here in Ontario.

59
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,670
He's from the UK.

60
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,510
And my sons have been training with him for about five, six years.

61
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,550
So they are kind of part of this today.

62
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,330
So I just wanted to show them and show the audience

63
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,350
and everybody that.

64
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,810
Today's topic, everyone, is carnivore for athletes and youth.

65
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,710
And I'm just going to quickly introduce myself.

66
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,510
And then I'll pass on you, Dr. Shafi,

67
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,310
to introduce yourself to my audience.

68
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:55,930
And to everybody.

69
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,050
My name is Jeff, everybody.

70
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,510
And I started a YouTube channel back in September,

71
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,230
because I've been on a journey.

72
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,650
And my new journey, my new mantra is to be cancer-free.

73
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,030
But today, I'm not going to be talking about how I have

74
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,990
stage four cool and cancer, because I've done many calls on that.

75
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,890
I want today to be different with Dr. Shafi.

76
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,710
I want to talk about carnivore, because I've had a lot of success.

77
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,410
I've been a carnivore for 20 months now.

78
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,590
And I've had a lot of success in terms of my own health

79
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,610
getting better.

80
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,270
And I am a high school phys ed teacher.

81
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,970
I have been for 21 years in my hometown

82
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,850
in Brantford, Ontario.

83
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,050
And I coach many, many sports.

84
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,890
I played varsity soccer for two universities here

85
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,270
in Ontario, Wilford, Laurier, and Brock University.

86
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,970
I had a lot of success as an athlete.

87
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,470
And I'm enjoying working with youth for the past 21 years,

88
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,010
coaching them and teaching them when it comes to phys ed sports

89
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,050
and nutrition.

90
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,930
So that's just a quick brief introduction

91
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,730
about myself, Dr. Shafi.

92
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,670
If you don't mind taking over and introducing

93
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,030
and telling me, tell everybody your credentials,

94
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,170
because it's pretty awesome.

95
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,370
Yeah, well, thanks.

96
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,370
Yeah, so my name's Dr. Anthony Chafi.

97
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,350
I'm an American physician.

98
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,410
I work in Australia at the moment.

99
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,050
Currently, in my residency for neurosurgery,

100
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,930
I also have a private practice in functional medicine,

101
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,450
metabolic health, sometimes called preventative medicine.

102
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,430
But same things you can do to prevent diseases,

103
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,230
you can do to reverse them.

104
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,030
And so we have a lot of patients with formally

105
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,250
Chaffee: with diabetes and obesity and autoimmune issues

106
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,470
Chaffee: and all sorts of other weird, wild and wonderful things

107
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,270
that are doing much better now,

108
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,150
because we address things at a root cause level,

109
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,810
which sort of ties into all my work online

110
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,530
in the carnivore diet, because something I've realized

111
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,390
as a physician, one of the most powerful tools

112
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,250
Chaffee: that we can use are dietary interventions.

113
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,870
Chaffee: You're eating the way we're supposed to eat

114
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,930
Chaffee: and design eat biologically,

115
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,850
is one of the strongest things you can do

116
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,690
to heal disease.

117
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,710
As Hapakridi said, 2,500 years ago,

118
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,090
Chaffee: before you heal anyone, first ask them

119
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,330
Chaffee: if they're willing to give up what is making them sick.

120
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,210
And that is so true today,

121
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,550
because everything that we're doing is what

122
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,510
is making us sick.

123
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,730
We're not sick because our bodies are just failing

124
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,830
and they're just cracking out and they're just breaking down

125
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,230
because we're deep, flunked species

126
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,010
and that's just how we're designed and made,

127
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,110
that's completely false.

128
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,250
We're designed to be extremely healthy

129
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,870
and we're built to be a very healthy

130
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,510
and animals are all very healthy.

131
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,870
Humans are supposed to be healthy.

132
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,550
So that's the idea is getting people back

133
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,770
to their natural state of health

134
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,930
and that's why I use the carnivore diet for it.

135
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,550
So I've been studying diet nutrition

136
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,070
for over 25 years.

137
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,410
I've been practicing as a doctor for 11 years

138
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,730
taking some breaks, doing humanitarian work here and there

139
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,390
and back at it, seeing patients full of time now.

140
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,450
And I played sports since I was a kid.

141
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,670
I trained in MMA at one of the top gyms in America.

142
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,670
They MCK boxing in Washington State with Matt Hume.

143
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,110
Since I was 14, I was there sort of every day

144
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,870
until I was 18 or so and I started playing rugby.

145
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:39,970
I was an all-American.

146
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,870
I started focusing mainly on that.

147
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,230
I played professionally for 10 years before medical school

148
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,010
and then kept playing throughout medical school

149
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,090
and beyond as well.

150
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,090
And so that has been a huge benefit to me as well,

151
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,090
especially because five years of those,

152
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,150
10 years I was on a carnivore diet

153
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,930
and I felt like I absolutely super hero.

154
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,570
And then the latter five years more experience

155
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,230
of older, I'm bigger, I'm stronger.

156
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,830
I should be better, but I wasn't anything close

157
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,710
to how dynamic and explosive and athletic that I was

158
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,710
in my first five years in my 20s.

159
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,950
So it's massive difference.

160
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,650
And now that I'm in my 40s,

161
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,090
I feel like I'm in my 20s again.

162
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,310
I feel like I'm in my early 20s

163
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,870
because I'm eating the way I did my early 20s.

164
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,010
I feel better now at 44 than I did at 28

165
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,650
playing professional rugby or 26, 27.

166
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,390
Chaffee: I just felt better than from 25 to 38.

167
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,850
Chaffee: I feel better now than I did that whole chunk of time.

168
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,730
So just trying to pass it along to people

169
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,070
and you know, show them the science behind it

170
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,550
that this works, it's not just a one-off

171
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,570
Chaffee: or a two-off or a one million off.

172
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,130
Chaffee: There's millions of people doing this now

173
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,270
Chaffee: and finding the same results.

174
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,130
But there's a reason for that

175
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,530
because it actually works.

176
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,350
Awesome.

177
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,990
Thank you, Dr. Shafi.

178
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,110
And I just want to say that all my subscribers

179
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,530
and Dr. Shafi subscribers,

180
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,210
if you could just hold off another about five to 10 minutes

181
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,450
for the questions because there are a few things

182
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,150
I want to talk to Dr. Shafi about.

183
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,130
And when we do start field in questions,

184
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,790
if you can put QQQ,

185
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,050
Dr. Shafi is that what you have your subscribers do?

186
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,510
Yeah, yeah, that's just make it obvious

187
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,310
that it's a question and we'll try to catch it.

188
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,830
Great. So thank you for the interaction, Dr. Shafi.

189
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,910
I just want you spoke about your credentials.

190
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,390
You spoke about your professional rugby,

191
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,870
your MMA training, everything that's great.

192
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,250
You have such an athletic history.

193
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,590
I want to make sure everybody understands that.

194
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,490
This gentleman that I'm honored to be on here with today.

195
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,870
He does brain surgeries during the day.

196
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,070
He works out, he's an athlete.

197
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,710
We're going to learn a lot here today.

198
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,270
And I'm hoping, Dr. Shafi,

199
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,850
because we start a late, do we still have an hour?

200
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,510
Can we go to about, I would say, 945 East, Eastern, is that okay?

201
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,110
Sure, that's fine.

202
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:05,950
Okay, that's great.

203
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,250
So before we get going and talk in a more questions,

204
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,990
I just want to say a little bit about my past.

205
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,030
I did talk about me playing University soccer,

206
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,410
but I grew up playing all sports.

207
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,630
From a young age, my dad got me in soccer at five years old.

208
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,890
And I ventured into also playing a lot of competitive basketball.

209
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,530
I wasn't, I didn't have the stature, the height for it.

210
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,430
Maybe if I was carnivore as a kid, I might have grown a few more inches.

211
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,150
But I got to about 5, 9, 5, 10.

212
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,570
And I was a point guard in high school.

213
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,790
I was running back in high school for football.

214
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,810
I played rugby actually as well.

215
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,430
I had an opportunity to go over to Ireland when I was in my last year high school.

216
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,390
And we did a little tour over there.

217
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,770
So, and then I went off the university medical university soccer.

218
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,330
So, I have quite a bit of experience.

219
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:03,170
And I just want to say, I always knew the power of meat

220
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,910
when it comes to giving you strength and energy

221
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,860
and repairing your muscles as well.

222
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,330
Especially growing up in an Italian culture household.

223
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,550
My mom always cooked very Mediterranean style,

224
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,690
but good fresh meat all the time.

225
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,150
And she knew the importance of it.

226
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:29,890
I grew up being a little bit obsessed with athletes, professional athletes.

227
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,070
Just like I am obsessed with you, Dr. Shafi, and all the doctors on YouTube right now,

228
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,850
because I'm on a different journey right now in my life.

229
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,070
But I grew up being obsessed with someone like Michael Jordan.

230
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,930
Michael Jordan was my biggest hero.

231
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,970
And obviously, from my hometown,

232
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,890
Bramford, Ontario, Wayne Gresky.

233
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,890
And now, in the soccer world, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

234
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,490
So, I was watching something online a few days ago about Michael Jordan.

235
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,990
And I knew this about him.

236
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,930
His pre-game meal was always a steak.

237
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,790
Always a steak steak steak.

238
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,270
And I guess he had a side of potatoes.

239
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,930
Wayne Gresky did the exact same thing.

240
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,130
And Lionel Messi, every single big soccer competition,

241
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,430
he gets hundreds of pounds of meat delivered to wherever he is,

242
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,470
so that he's performing.

243
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,930
So, I just want to say, and driving here this morning to my son's soccer training,

244
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,050
we listen to motivational speakers all the time.

245
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,350
And this morning, we were listening to Kobe Bryant.

246
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,830
Because Kobe Bryant is quite motivational when it comes to improving oneself.

247
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,710
And he talks about the bamba mentality,

248
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,850
and he talks about how you want to be the best version of yourself,

249
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,610
and improving yourself day to day.

250
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,910
So, I just wanted to say, that's one way we can encourage our youth

251
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,670
and our athletes having role models and seeing what they've done,

252
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,950
especially when it comes to diet, when it comes to the carnivore diet,

253
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,430
Michael Jordan, always having a steak before every single meal.

254
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:07,210
Kobe Bryant saying that we need to improve day to day and be the best version of our self.

255
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,730
So, this is why I'm saying, this topic today, it's true to my heart

256
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,530
in terms of working with athletes, working with youth as an educator.

257
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,190
And, you know, I think that's where we're going to go with today,

258
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,970
Dr. Shafi, is that sound good? Sounds good? Awesome.

259
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:29,150
So, I just take a look at my agenda here quickly.

260
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,870
I've talked about my past, you talked about your past.

261
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,340
Athletes today, Dr. Shafi, can you explain

262
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,000
where they're getting their energy from? And,

263
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,640
I know there's three different macro nutrients, and maybe we can explain to the audience the options

264
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,440
that athletes have when it comes to energy and performing. Is that sound right?

265
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:04,400
Sure. Yeah. Well, so, I mean, one, a lot of people, most people,

266
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,960
are getting their energy from carbohydrates. We've been told for the last 40, 50 years that

267
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,800
Chaffee: we have to eat carbs in order to burn carbs. Even the, the golden era bodybuilders like

268
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,340
Chaffee: Vince Garanda, who's a steak and egg steak and egg steak and eggs are like that's what we're

269
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,120
supposed to be eating. That's what humans have been eating forever. That's what we're supposed to eat.

270
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,760
Even he thought that you needed to do a carb day once a week, because he said,

271
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,500
you need to replenish the glycogen in your liver and the only way to do that is eating carbs.

272
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,040
I saw that. That was a quote of his. That's not the case. You know, that's not the case.

273
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,540
They may have been what they understood at the time. That's not true. In fact, there have been

274
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:52,060
studies in athletes, in humans, showing that ketogenic athletes replenish their muscle and

275
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:59,300
liver glycogen faster than carb-fueled athletes drinking sugar water like gatorate, right?

276
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,300
So, you know, it's not only can you do it, you can do it better naturally on your own.

277
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,640
Chaffee: So, at the moment, everyone's just sucking down sugar and sugar water and sugar pills and

278
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,360
Chaffee: you know, gatorate became this whole big thing. The original gatorate was just electrolytes.

279
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,200
Chaffee: It didn't have just a ton of sugar. Now, it's all sugar. It's barely any electrolytes.

280
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,460
And that's what people, people run on. They think you have to have all these carbs,

281
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,200
Chaffee: all these carbs, all these sorts of things, which is not the case. I'm sure you experience this

282
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,100
Chaffee: in your athletic career, you know, that concept of hitting the wall. That was something that was

283
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,540
Chaffee: very familiar to us when I was growing up. You push yourself. You push yourself and then you hit

284
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,840
the wall. You just have nothing left in the tank. You just dead. Most people stop at that point.

285
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,260
Most people don't even get to that point. But if you hit that point and you keep going and you keep

286
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,840
going and you push yourself and push yourself, sometimes we'll talk about breaking through the wall

287
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,420
Chaffee: and you get your second wind and your runners high. You can just keep going and going and

288
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,040
Chaffee: going and going and going. What that is biologically or biochemically is you're running on

289
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,040
carbohydrate rates. Your insulin is up and your fat cells are blocked. You cannot mobilize

290
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,820
an energy from your fat cells. And so you only run on the glucose and glycogen that you have

291
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,200
in your body from your last few meals. And that's finite. That's going to run out. And there's

292
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,400
not that much of it. You have 10, 20, 30 times as much energy stored in your adipose tissue,

293
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,960
even in very slender people. Then you can maximally store in glycogen in your muscles and

294
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,740
liver. So it's massive, massive, energy stores there. They're just going to waste if you don't tap

295
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,900
Chaffee: into them. So what breaking through the wall is that you've run out of glycogen, you feel like

296
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,180
garbage. Your blood sugar is dropping and you can't get it up and you feel horrible. So you can't

297
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,240
get your blood sugar up. You can't mobilize glycogen. You can't mobilize blood sugar. You can't

298
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,000
Chaffee: make key tones. You keep pushing. Normally, insulin takes about 24 hours to come down to a

299
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,800
Chaffee: reasonable amount that you can start. You're getting your key tones up and your blood sugar up.

300
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,880
Chaffee: But if you force the issue instead of letting you die, your body shifts gears and starts mobilizing

301
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,320
your fat source. And obviously, you have all this energy again because now you're tapped into your

302
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:22,280
fat stores. And now you can just go and go and go. So a key to genic athlete is always in their second

303
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,060
they're always in their runner side. They're always past the wall. They're never going to run

304
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,480
into the wall because they started after the wall and they can just go. And that's what I experienced

305
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:41,140
as an athlete in my early 20s from 20 to 25 where they're about. And I could not get tired.

306
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,720
I could not run out of energy. I just could go and go and go. Now there's a limit. I mean,

307
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,720
your muscles have a specific limit, your lung capacity and all these sorts of things. But if you're

308
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,320
yourself maximum, you will have energy. You know, your your body may not be able to go with you,

309
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,200
but you'll have the energy to do what everything that your body can handle. And then when you're

310
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,580
pushing yourself that hard and you're doing so much more and you're going so much harder,

311
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,500
Chaffee: you get in much more fit. And you recover much better when you're just eating me. And your body

312
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,520
Chaffee: heals better and you build muscle better and you build strength and endurance better. And so

313
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:25,440
Chaffee: your performance and your athleticism just goes up at an astounding exponential sort of pace.

314
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,260
Chaffee: And so you can get very, very good shape. And eventually I got in such a good shape that I

315
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:36,260
simply could not push myself to the point that that I would wear myself out. I could not. I was

316
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,640
sprinting a quid moons little marathon. I just sprint for a mile, dead sprint for a mile.

317
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,420
And then I just run hard for my I could just keep going. I just figured, you know, I just like

318
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,000
all right, and I was just, I said, I do this much so I did that much. It wasn't like I was like,

319
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,220
oh, it was just, it was fine. It was no issue. And then I was running hard. And then it was a dead sprint

320
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,580
for another mile. And then running hard for a mile. And then dead and I just did this. I just kept doing this.

321
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,620
And eventually I would just stop after I did, you know, 10, 15 miles. I would just be like,

322
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,620
okay, I've just gone up and down the bowl of order in the on Lake Washington bowl of order

323
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:18,100
in Kirk and Washington, I've run up and down by the by the lake front there in the summer, especially

324
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:25,860
and I just do, it was three miles up, three miles back. And so I do that, you know, two times,

325
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,500
Chaffee: three times. And then just be, I just was already bored. I'm like, I get, do I just stop now? I could have

326
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,560
Chaffee: just kept going forever just sprinting a mile running hard for a mile, sprinting a mile running hard

327
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,780
Chaffee: for just sprinting the whole time. And I would just get bored because running stupid.

328
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,320
You know, I'm going to agree with you right there, Dr. Sheffey. And I'm going to say this to

329
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,320
all of everybody at listening. I've been a high school physician for 21 years and I've told my

330
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,120
students many times, I hate running. I can't stand it, right? I like to run on the pitch,

331
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,980
on the soccer pitch, the rugby pitch, the basketball court, whatever. I need to be motivated

332
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,420
in that sense to be running. So that's that's that's amazing, Dr. Sheffey. You from your experience,

333
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,920
because I haven't really had a chance to really experience being in the state of ketosis and

334
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,440
being in athlete the way you have, because you did it twice. You did it when you're in your 20s

335
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,680
correct, and then for five years, and then you did it kind of later on in life, right? Like,

336
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,580
just recently, right now. So the next thing I want to, I want to say Dr. Sheffey is from my experience

337
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:36,660
from the last 20 months, myself and even with my sons as carnivores, because they are too,

338
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,940
and I'm looking at them on the pitch right now. And I'm really proud of them because

339
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:48,200
and many parents that are listening to this, my son, Peter, he won't eat a vegetable ever again

340
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:55,980
in his life. And I used to, five years ago, I used to, it was a struggle. We would make him,

341
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,900
he always liked me, and we would make my wife would make broccoli, and he would sit there for an

342
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,600
hour, two hours. You're not leaving the table until you finish those five broccoli. And to me,

343
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,140
that was abuse. We were abusing him. So anyways, he will never eat broccoli.

344
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:18,240
Chaffee: Being that kid, and it felt like abuse. Absolutely. We're going to talk later on about parents

345
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,340
and what they're doing to their children later on. But I wanted to just expand on what you're talking

346
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:29,520
about a little bit from my experience. Last summer, I was hitting a gym quite hard. As a stage

347
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,040
for cancer patient, with my sons, we joined a gym, and just recently built a gym in our basement.

348
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,200
And the one thing that I've noticed, Dr. Sheffey, and I speak about this, because I actually

349
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,660
caught a weightlifting course for the past 10 years at my high school. And it's very basic. And I teach

350
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:53,740
the kids about hypertrophy in terms of your muscle fibers growing and getting bigger and stronger.

351
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:03,280
And I talk about Dom's delayed onset muscle soreness. And basically, when I was working out with

352
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,920
my teenagers that I teach, and I went really hard in terms of heavy weights, like squats,

353
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:15,960
or bench, or back, I would have Dom's delayed onset muscle soreness, either 24 hours later,

354
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,560
or 48 hours later. And it would last, sometimes when I did squats, I couldn't even put my socks

355
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,160
on the next day, because it was so bad. And I was carved dependent this time. Like, this is a big

356
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,540
time carved dependent. So in the past summer, I was working out the boys, and I was getting the

357
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:38,520
weights quite up there again. And I noticed, I didn't, I haven't had any soreness. I don't have any

358
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,420
soreness anymore. I don't have that same delayed onset muscle soreness. And is it because I'm

359
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,980
using fat as fuel, and I'm having adequate amounts of protein in me, that I'm repairing my

360
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,920
muscles very quickly? Can you expand on that a little more in terms of the muscle soreness in the recovery?

361
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,580
Yeah, it's really just from plant toxins. Right? These are inflammatory factors that are in the

362
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,340
Chaffee: lads that are trying to deter you. So the plants trying to make you sick is trying to make

363
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,820
Chaffee: sore. It's trying to screw up your hormones. It's trying to poison you. So you stop eating it.

364
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,020
You know, it's just trying to tell you, no one's certain terms back the hell off. You know,

365
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,640
I'm going to hurt you. I'm going to be bad for you. And so if you're around in the wild, and you

366
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,120
just feel like a superhero all the time, and you're really hungry, and you're like, well, I'll just

367
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,200
I'll just try this instead of going to hunting. I'll try chewing on this, you know, sort of taste

368
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,880
bitter, but yeah, whatever. And all of a sudden, you're just sore and miserable, and you're like,

369
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,740
never again, I'm never touching that thing again. If it doesn't kill you, right? Because a lot of them

370
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,780
do kill you. Most of them will kill you if you try that. So don't try that. And so that's the thing.

371
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,520
You have these inflammatory factors that are causing inflammation, pain, stiffness swelling,

372
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,500
and soreness, and they can act on other parts of your body that are healing as well. So you have

373
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,180
areas of some sort of nightess for a damage like arthritis, you have damage of the cartilage,

374
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:07,360
your bones are scraping together, which is always an unpleasant image. You have an injury,

375
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,320
you have sciatica, you have compression on a nerve, you have all these different sorts of things

376
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:19,680
Chaffee: that are a bit of a problem, but now they're exacerbated. You have all this inflammation that

377
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,100
Chaffee: is making that pain signal 10 times worse. And so when you just get rid of that, it just goes away.

378
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:32,840
Chaffee: Do an experiment. You have all the same protein, all the same ketones, and fat, and all that

379
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,260
sort of stuff. You'll be in ketosis. You'll be running on fat. Have all this protein,

380
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:43,320
drink one cup of coffee. Let me know how you feel. You'll be sore for two days. So it's not the

381
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,540
lack of protein in fat. It's not the lack of being in ketosis. ketosis does help because

382
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:54,180
when the ketones are higher, they directly suppress inflame zones, and that will reduce the pain

383
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,780
swelling, and all that sort of stuff all on its own. But if you drink coffee that shouldn't

384
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,500
kick you out of ketosis, it's not going to stop you from having the protein that you just ate,

385
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,940
and the fat, and everything like that, but it will make you sore. So there are inflammatory

386
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:15,780
factors and chemicals that are harmful that we experience that as pain. And that's part of

387
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,160
that's part of that experience. So we know that there's these toxins that are in there,

388
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,580
and they say, oh, but is there dose makes the poison? Well, look, the dose is pretty damn small

389
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,840
because one cup of coffee will have you sore for two days. It's just that no one stops eating these

390
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,900
things. So they don't realize that they are being poisoned, that they actually have a much greater

391
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:43,300
effect on their body than they take for granted, or they take that for granted. And so I'm

392
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,180
Chaffee: just going to write a note for myself. But like, so that's the thing. So it's inflammatory

393
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:53,080
Chaffee: factors. So, you know, not being in ketosis, you know, sure that that will have you'll have higher

394
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:59,100
information then. But they're they're due seem to be just actual toxins in the plants that will

395
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:06,260
mess you up. I certainly find that the grains and beans and legumes and seeds, they make that

396
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:12,460
Chaffee: pain come back far worse. So, you know, when I was sort of experimenting early on, I was at a restaurant

397
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,200
Chaffee: and I had had some beans and rice sort of mixed in with some of the meat that it was like chopped

398
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,840
Chaffee: meat. And so I was like trying to scrape it off and it's just a little bit of rice and a little bit

399
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,720
Chaffee: of meat. But it was like a little smear on it. It wasn't even like big chunks of it. I was thinking,

400
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,160
I'm like, I'm getting a little bit of this in me. Like, well, maybe I'll just take a spoonful of the

401
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,980
Chaffee: rice and a spoonful of beans and just see what it does to me. Right. And then I said, no, I'm not going

402
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,020
Chaffee: to do that because if I make an excuse to do that, even for an experiment, I'll make excuse to

403
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:42,900
for other things. I'm just not going to do it. So I just did that. Thank God, I didn't do that.

404
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:50,600
Because just a little residue of beans and rice on this, it felt like someone was stabbing me

405
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:57,620
in the spine in my lower back for the next four days. And it, when did this happen? Dr. Sheffey?

406
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,820
How long ago? Six years ago. Six years ago. Six years ago. Yeah. Yeah, I actually went to dinner

407
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,040
with a pro soccer player in Seattle funny enough. And then we sort of went, they got this like,

408
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,660
yeah, it was like a Mexican place and just had this little beans and rice on an

409
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,220
ass and proud without the beans and rice. And of course, it came on the beans and rice,

410
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:23,040
like shit. I'm like scraping this stuff off. And, you know, I felt, you know, as a bit funny that

411
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,480
day, not a big deal. The next day I woke up and I could not get out of bed. I tried to get out

412
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,180
like, oh, it was just like something just stabbing the back. I was like, whoa, what's wrong? What's

413
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,720
going on? It was, it was debilitating pain. That I could not sit up out of bed. I was in so much pain.

414
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,460
It took, I don't know, how many minutes to sort of like shimmy over. I tried to like,

415
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,720
sort of move over and roll over with so painful. And I was able to sort of finally get on my,

416
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,660
on my front and then I sort of was able to push myself up on all fours, slide over to the side

417
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,600
and get into a sitting position on the side of the bed and just sit there and breathe and

418
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,140
catch my breath and then slowly sort of work my way up and stand up. And I'm like, oh my god,

419
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,700
what a hell happened in my back. And I just had to be, I had to be locked rigid, straight and stand

420
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,200
up because I couldn't, I couldn't let being bent forward or anything like that. And it was very

421
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,440
difficult to get in and out of chairs and then lying down. If I moved in the middle of the night,

422
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:22,160
like, in my sleep, it would wake me up. It would shock me awake from the pain four days. That

423
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,980
wow. That's crazy. Yeah. Dr. Shafi, you know, I'm listening to you,

424
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,680
speak about that experience. That's, it's mind blowing or what you had experienced just by a little bit

425
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:41,920
of that, of that poison that you ate. But I look at, I look at there, are you today, and what I've

426
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,360
been experiencing as a teacher, a coach, an educator, and the youth I'm dealing with. I'm constantly

427
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:56,100
hearing kids complain about them being sore, being tired, over, over, over, they, they worked at

428
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,900
over, did it. And you know, even with my, and it's a reflection, it's got to be a reflection of

429
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,560
their diets and what they're eating because carbohydrates is through the roof. You can barely

430
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,600
go into any restaurant, any grocery store where they're pushing it in our face, right? Carbohydrates,

431
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,340
refined sugars, GMOs, all that stuff. And you know, I'm looking at Peter and Dante on the pitch right

432
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,040
now and Peter's constantly talking to me about because they both actually have fitness once a week

433
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:27,860
and they work out hard with, with, with the fitness instructor. And Peter says all his teammates

434
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:33,120
complain about being sore after and he does, he's not feeling that. So it's really, it's, I'm

435
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,240
really proud to hear him say that. And I just, you know, I just want to, I just wanted to add that

436
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,500
in, Dr. Shafi. And I'm looking at my, I'm getting tons of comments. My, my feed, a lot of people

437
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,820
are talking and communicating. And this is great. And the conversations that they're having in,

438
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,220
my, on my channel is great. I'm sure there's a lot of stuff happening on your channel right now

439
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,560
to Dr. Shafi. So I, I just want to say to everybody, we're going to start taking some questions.

440
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,260
Q, I, I, I, I just got my first Q, Q, Q come in. But it will start with Dr. Shafi. But even before

441
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,200
you pull up your first question, I just want to give a huge shout out because I'm super excited,

442
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:14,380
Dr. Shafi. I'm wearing this brand new t-shirt. Okay, that carry man sent me in the mail. I just got it.

443
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,620
It's healing humanity. It's the documentary he's making. It's about the power of the proper

444
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:25,360
human diet. So I'm really proud. And I'm also wearing my Dr. Shafi hat today. Okay, I bought this.

445
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,020
Like, I bought this a few months ago. And I, I, I have to wear every time I'm on with Dr. Shafi.

446
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,980
And I, I am a big, as, as athletes, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm big into Nike because of Michael Jordan.

447
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,240
And, and Adidas is more of a soccer brand, which I was, I was into back in, when I was playing

448
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,720
university soccer. Some of my favorite players like Alessandro Delpiro, David Beckham, they were,

449
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,960
they were Adidas. So I do like that brand as well. So I just want to say, I'm representing

450
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,280
Carrie Mann. I'm representing Dr. Shafi today. And I'm super excited as this, as this,

451
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,540
this live podcast continues on. So Dr. Shafi, do you want to pop up your first question?

452
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:19,020
If you got one there, um, yeah, see, see, I didn't actually, let me see, see if I have some of these,

453
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:25,640
so I don't have them start. I got one right. I don't want to go. Why don't you go for, I'll take a look

454
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,540
through. I guess this is one of my favorite subscribers. Her name is Sandra, one hole for all,

455
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:37,420
so high Sandra. And I just want to say she, she's got a question here. If the young man who's not

456
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:44,840
overweight is working out and wants to build muscle, should he have more protein than fat? I used

457
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,820
the babysit this guy six years old and tell him he should be a carnivore. So should they have more

458
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,580
Chaffee: protein than fat working out, not overweight? No, you know, you generally need to, I mean,

459
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,980
Chaffee: you'll need enough fat, you'll need enough protein. Even if you're working out,

460
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,180
you actually tend to need a lot of fat for the, for the energy that you'll, that you'll be

461
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:12,260
Chaffee: spending. So that's where a lot of your energy comes from. It's fat. If you don't have enough fat,

462
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,940
Chaffee: you'll start converting more protein into energy. And you won't be using that for a building block

463
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,760
Chaffee: anyway, you'll be using it for energy. So really, what you want to do, you want to a lot of fat,

464
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,440
you want a lot of meat. You still want it about the same proportions. And so you just, you just eat

465
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,380
fatty meat until it stops tasting good. You eat enough fat so that you don't get constipated.

466
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,080
And do you body takes care of the rest? You know, it's usually about one to two grams of

467
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,880
fat for one gram of protein. That's usually how that works out. But your people's bodies will change

468
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,140
on their demand. They'll need a bit more protein. Sometimes we'll need a bit more fat. Sometimes

469
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,560
but you can, you can tend to, you'll tend to figure that out intuitively. Your body will just sort

470
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,800
Chaffee: of tell you. And so to go by taste and more lean meat will start tasting really, really good.

471
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,580
Chaffee: You'll sort of be a bit over the fat, but it's only in taste, really good. Those sorts of things,

472
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:04,500
you know, will, will kick you off and give you a hint of what your body wants. And so

473
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:11,000
Chaffee: you just listen to that, really. Here's another one. Can I go body building with only meat?

474
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:17,620
I think we kind of touched on that. We definitely, the energy source we can use is definitely fat.

475
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,830
And I've had no, I've had no problem using it when I've been working out.

476
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,860
Chaffee: Yeah. Well, and specifically for body builders, all the professional body builders in the

477
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,560
Chaffee: golden era of body building, Vince Garonda, Serge New Gray, those guys, they were steak and

478
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:36,320
steak and steak and steak and steak and steak and steak. Serge New Gray would eat six pounds of

479
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,160
horse meat a day. Right. The guy was just like a, like a Mongol warrior. He was just an absolute beast.

480
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,760
And he was Arnold Schwarzenegger's body in a body idol. That's who Arnold Schwarzenegger grew up saying,

481
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,600
Chaffee: I want to look like that guy. Right. And then Arnold Schwarzenegger, what did he do? He didn't do the

482
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,460
Chaffee: game changer bullshit that he's, that he's trying to push now because he's selling it on trying

483
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,820
to help his, his buddy James Cameron, make a mint on his P protein company. And that's what

484
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,560
that is. I was just a giant commercial because James Cameron, who was the EP on that,

485
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,340
Chaffee: he owns like $140 million worth of a P protein company. So it's just, oh, hey, you know,

486
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,420
Chaffee: you don't want to eat meat all so bad, but you need protein. Hey, we've judged. I'm going to have

487
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,680
Chaffee: some right here. Yeah. Why do you buy it? Arnold Schwarzenegger is a vegetarian vegan now, right?

488
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:29,260
Chaffee: My ass. You know, like he's just now. Of course, he's not. I don't know. He's aging quite quickly.

489
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,160
Chaffee: Well, he doesn't look good anyway. I mean, it's not, it's not a, it's not a, you know, if he's,

490
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:40,720
if he is vegan vegetarian, it's not, it's not working well for him. I mean, he's older anyway, but,

491
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,260
you know, Maggie's older than him. Maggie's an over a decade older than him. She looks better than him.

492
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,220
But, you know, although all the old school guys, including Arnold were steak and eggs,

493
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,420
steak and eggs, steak and eggs, steak and eggs. Sometimes they include carbs once a week,

494
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,680
because they thought that you needed to store glycogen that way. That's wrong. You don't need to do that.

495
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,840
There are professional bodybuilders right now who only eat meat. Ronnie Coleman, apparently,

496
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:12,060
hated vegetables. He thought they were bad for him, so he wouldn't eat them. I know a guy here who

497
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,920
helped like, how's the company that helped like make Ronnie Coleman supplements his line of supplements.

498
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,300
Chaffee: And, and he was telling me that he's told me that Ronnie Coleman was like, yeah, he's like,

499
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,060
Chaffee: telling us, like, oh, hey, here's the guy saying that vegetables. I told you, I told you vegetables

500
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:32,840
were bad those things are awful. And so, yeah, that's the thing. So, I did a, specifically on bodybuilding.

501
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,680
I've done posts on that. I've done videos on that. And I've interviewed a lot of professional

502
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,600
bodybuilders who have just done keto or even just carnivore. And, and been like European

503
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:53,780
pro champion natural in a, in a non-tested competition. So, this was with pros that were on the juice

504
00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:01,160
and he was natural. And, and he won the whole European pro championship. That was Richard Smith

505
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:10,080
who goes by keto pro on Instagram. And, we have a, a couple YouTube videos together where we talk

506
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,900
Chaffee: about all this stuff. And we go on through the science. I've been talking to his, his experiences.

507
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,900
Chaffee: And, and he got absolutely jacked and shredded. He said it was just cheating. It was so easy to get

508
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,300
complete, so shredded on a carnivore diet. It was even easier than doing it on keto. So, yes,

509
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,160
you can definitely do bodybuilding on on a carnivore diet. In fact, you'll be better off

510
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:40,060
Chaffee: because if you're eating a whole bunch of carbs like, yeah, you'll put on bulk. Oh, I got a bulk. I

511
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:45,360
put on fat if you're going to put on muscle, bullshit. You only put on fat if you're eating carbs.

512
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,100
If you only eating meat, you will not put on fat. You will only put on muscle. And, you'll,

513
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,020
so everything you put on is just lean body, body mess. It's lean muscle mess. I said,

514
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,620
well, you have to have a chloric surplus. No, if you have a chloric surplus, you'll put on fat.

515
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,580
You'll put on muscle. You know, so, you know, like the, for the stand effort is out there.

516
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:11,720
It's just like, learn some goddamn biology, you know, and math. You know, it's chloric surplus

517
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:18,580
equals storing fat. That's the whole idea, even though calories are a bit of a nonsense. But,

518
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,160
Chaffee: the whole idea is you eat more food than your body has demand for. You're going to store it as

519
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,420
energy, right? It's not just going to just like, well, I guess we got it all, I guess we'll just put it

520
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:35,560
in the muscle. You know, that's not what happened. Your body of a stimulus to build a certain amount of

521
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,780
put into fat. So you need to eat enough. And that's the same thing you can do. You just eat

522
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,840
until you're, until meat stops tasting good fatty meat stops tasting good. Your body will tell

523
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,440
you how much it needs. And so you don't need to calculate that out. And you'll only put on lean

524
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Chaffee: muscle. So the, the golden era body builder guys, like Garanda and Serge New Gray, even Arnold,

525
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:01,660
you know, you look at him. Arnold was never in this puffy fat stage. He was always jacked. And he

526
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:08,680
got more shredded coming up to competition. But he was already pretty damn shredded. And so

527
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,460
his Serge New Gray and Vince Garanda, they were just always ripped your round. And then they just get a

528
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,360
little more lean just for competition. And that's it. So that's, that's, that's, it's a huge advantage

529
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:28,240
to be on a corner for one of all your builder. Absolutely. Thanks, Dr. Shafi. I, I, I, I, I love the passion

530
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,860
that you get into answer in these questions. So the, the subscriber is keep, keep asking these

531
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,520
good questions. And I apologize if I'm missing anything. I, I got some questions popping up. Here's

532
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,780
another one. My dad is two months on carnivore and his triglycerides went up from mid 80s to 130

533
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:51,940
and his hdl, hdl dropped from 90s to 65. Is there any reason for concern?

534
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,900
Chaffee: Well, so it's, it's, it's, it's, you have to, sort of ask, you know, wonder, are, are there,

535
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,220
Chaffee: is he really doing carnivores, he having other things, is he eating other things, having

536
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:07,440
Chaffee: his sugar drinking alcohol, artificial sweeteners, any of these other sorts of things. Because,

537
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,540
Chaffee: you know, you typically, you would see sort of the other way around. You see triglycerides come

538
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:16,840
down, hdl go up, things like that. Um, however, things like stress, people can really stress

539
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,440
down, not sleeping really well. That can negatively affect both of those numbers. I don't even

540
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,060
test those things anymore. It was a fun, they were useless. I think that testing,

541
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,000
it's cholesterol was just a con in the first place. Why are we even testing anymore? I just

542
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,320
say we ignored it and let it, like, nor did let it go away because it was a con from the beginning.

543
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,400
And so why are we paying attention to it now? I think it's a waste of time and money to get,

544
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,240
to get your cholesterol checked. However, um, thing that we should realize, hey, stress can

545
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,380
make this worse, poor sleep can make that worse. And lower hdl and higher triglycerides probably

546
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,920
the only useful thing in your cholesterol panel, except for higher LDL and total cholesterol,

547
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:59,920
I mean, you're statistically more likely to live longer. So that's good. Um, but it's not where

548
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,020
we think it is anyway. And if you have low hdl and higher triglycerides, it can show metabolic

549
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:10,960
dysfunction. And so, and that can come about from stress and from poor sleep, as well as a bad

550
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,680
Chaffee: diet and drinking alcohol and things like that. Um, one thing to remember too, is that if you take

551
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,320
Chaffee: cholesterol 10 times in the same day, you'll get 10 different results. And so, oh my god, what's happening?

552
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:27,500
If you work out the day before, you'll have different results. If you have sex before you go

553
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,400
and get your cholesterol tests, you'll have different results or the day before. Right? If you're

554
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,580
stressed out leading up to it, you're going to have different results. So you need to, you need to get

555
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,200
first of all, you need to get multiple data points, right? See, I mean, one of those could have just

556
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,140
Chaffee: been an aberrant test, could have just been something off. It's not actually indicative of

557
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:54,220
Chaffee: regular trend. And so, you need multiple tests to see what's going on. Um, so, you want to do the same

558
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,740
in the same way every time. It can assist in pattern. You want to do it the same time in the morning,

559
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,540
every morning, you know, usually between 8.9 a.m., you want to fast for the exact same period of time.

560
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,500
If you fast for 10 hours, and then you fast for 12 hours, you'll get two different results.

561
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,380
And so, and you can try that. Take your bloods, take it at 8 in the morning, take it at 10 in the

562
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:21,740
right? You will get two different results. You know, take your tests, work out, go take it again,

563
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:28,460
you'll get two different results. This is such a volatile test. It's so useless. So you take it

564
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,040
in the same time of the morning between 8.9 a.m., fasting from 9.p.m. the night before, only water

565
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:40,340
after that, only water in the morning, no coffee, tea, supplements, medications, until after your

566
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,380
test. You take at least two glasses of water, no more than four glasses of water, same hydration

567
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:50,960
instead of. If you're taking any B vitamins or anything that contains biotin, which is a B vitamin,

568
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,240
that can disrupt your hormones, that can disrupt your blood tests, that can change your

569
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:01,120
Chaffee: results as well. So stop those for three days before you take your blood test and then be very calm

570
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,820
Chaffee: and relax and no stress for the certainly the morning of in a couple of days leading up to it.

571
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,640
Don't get pissed off and traffic on your way in to getting the blood test,

572
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,580
you know, don't get it in a fight with someone in your family or get pissed off.

573
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,580
I'm getting kids out of the house and go to school, just be chill. And no stress exercise or

574
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,020
sexual activity the morning over the day before your test. You do it all those things consistently,

575
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,100
you'll get much more consistent results. And then, you need a few more data points.

576
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,520
You know, I wouldn't worry too much about it. You know, check it again in three months and then

577
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,300
three months, six months, whatever, cholesterol was never the problem. You know, as metabolic health

578
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:45,020
could be impacted and that could change his HGL and then triglycerides. A carnivore diet is only

579
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:50,780
going to improve that. Saturated fat is known to raise your HDL and eating carbohydrates and sugar

580
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:56,820
and alcohol and seed oils, raise your triglycerides. You're not eating any of that and you're eating,

581
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,460
you know, so your triglycerides are going to come down. You're all eating saturated fat things

582
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:05,420
are good for you. So your HDL is going to go up and you're in the right metabolic state and that's

583
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:11,780
going to help you as well. So then you optimize sleep and stress and you'll be fine. I wouldn't

584
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,520
worry too much about it. Just try to make things consistent in that pattern so you get reliable

585
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:24,460
test results and reduce stress, prioritize sleep, get out on the sun and chill out. Maybe

586
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:34,880
fine. Absolutely. The whole stress thing and keep in your cells calm, keep in your mitochondria

587
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,300
and healthy is a huge thing that I'm learning about quite often. So I make a lot of sense. There's

588
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:48,240
a lot of variables that definitely affect things and we're always quick to blaming the carnivore

589
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,220
diet or only eating meat and the people don't really understand there's a lot of other things.

590
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:57,160
You're like you're right, especially sleep, Dr. Shaky, that's something that we need to pay attention

591
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,180
to a little more. Just looking, I got so many questions. If you ever want to pop a question out,

592
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,700
let me know Dr. Shaky, but I have this, I've had this one up for a bit. Jeff, did your boys decide

593
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:17,080
to adopt the carnivore diet on their own? Obviously, not on their own. Obviously, parents

594
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:28,810
do and they should influence their kids on how to be successful in life. And Mike, my two boys,

595
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:35,350
I can only imagine the life they're living with their father, myself having stage 4 cancer,

596
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:44,030
but they've been amazing teammates for me along my journey and we've been watching people like Dr.

597
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:51,250
Shaky, Dr. Baker, Dr. Kilt's talk about all their success they've been having on the carnivore diet.

598
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:57,490
Chaffee: We're listening to it all the time, so my sons have realized and they're pretty smart boys

599
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:03,810
that they want to be as optimal as possible in life. And I'm really proud of my son Peter. He's in grade

600
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:10,210
10. Last year in grade nine, he had a 96% average. He actually participated in six different

601
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:17,950
school sports. Wow, still participating in his club soccer and the soccer that he's doing right now.

602
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:22,690
He's go-go-go all the time and he's really focused and for a teenager,

603
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:30,910
not saying all teenagers are bad, teenagers are great, they're the best people ever,

604
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:38,810
but he's a little more focused than your normal teenager. And I think the diet has helped a lot.

605
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:47,190
I think his mental clarity is through the roof. He's focused. He's a wild plan, especially as a boy,

606
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:52,430
as a teenager, and I'm really proud of him. So they didn't do it on their own.

607
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:59,190
I definitely being involved in my life, it's motivated them to be as optimal as possible.

608
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:04,150
So that's that. Do you have any questions you want to pop up? Dr. Shaky,

609
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:10,390
I think we're both seeing the same, was that both from both our feeds will pop up there?

610
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:15,790
Is it? Oh, is it? Okay, okay, that's good. I didn't know. I'm new to disguise. I apologize. My technical

611
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:20,630
skills aren't the greatest. Here I'll pop this one up here. Taking away the taste aspect,

612
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,770
how many grains of protein would you recommend per pound for the average person?

613
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:31,010
And for someone building muscle, I understand to start with equal parts fat and adjust.

614
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:38,370
Yeah, it's a difficult one to answer. I mean, you think about how complex or biochemistry is

615
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:42,010
in our metabolic demands, especially when people in different states or everything like that.

616
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:47,970
Like you have tens of trillions of cells, they have tens of trillions of chemical reactions,

617
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:55,350
you have every few seconds. So this is so much more complex than we could ever calculate.

618
00:45:55,350 --> 00:46:01,110
Chaffee: There is no equation that's complex enough to figure out exactly what our dailyins and

619
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:06,990
Chaffee: else need to be. We simply don't have the variables, all the different things that we're doing

620
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:12,450
on that day-to-day basis. So there's really no way to calculate that. Just like one gram of

621
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:23,870
protein per kilo, that's sort of nonsense. I guess it's sort of a rough guide, but it's not going

622
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:30,710
Chaffee: to be a fantasy. But it doesn't matter because you don't have to. You don't have to figure it out.

623
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:35,230
Chaffee: Your body figures it out. I've never seen a koala pull out a calculator to figure out their

624
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:40,850
macros, right? And yet they know how much they're supposed to eat because they just eat it.

625
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,030
And so if you're eating what you're supposed to eat, your hunger and your taste signals will

626
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:52,410
Chaffee: tell you how much to eat. So it's hard to say, if someone is trying to build muscle,

627
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:57,050
Chaffee: you're going to need more than you did before. If you're static and you're environment,

628
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:01,010
and you're just sort of sedentary just having normal life, you're going to, you remind me

629
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:06,030
the X. When I start working out and I start lifting weights a lot, I need to eat 2X. So I'll

630
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:11,530
literally twice as much during the day, but it's purely driven by my hunger. I'm not saying,

631
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:15,830
I'm not, you know, this stand-up or things going on. I have to force myself to do that. No,

632
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:22,290
my body doesn't form me and I naturally will be more hungry and my body will want more.

633
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:27,010
If I'm not able to get it as much as my body wants, I'm not able to eat twice a day or something

634
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:32,710
like that or get enough when I do. I simply won't put on the muscle mass that I would have

635
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:40,950
Chaffee: otherwise. If I'm able to eat as much as my body's telling me to, I will put on muscle extraordinarily

636
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:52,130
Chaffee: easy. It's easier and more easily than I've ever experienced in my entire life. So it's pretty, it's

637
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:56,070
going to be different. It's going to be different for your size certainly, but it's also going to be

638
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:00,930
different for your metabolic demand. You know, if people, you know, I've worked with anorexics,

639
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,330
Chaffee: recovered, recovered anorexic who actually go carnivore and recover from anorexia. And

640
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:16,130
Chaffee: little small women that are like a BMI of nine at one point. And now they're eating meat again

641
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:21,190
Chaffee: and they're doing amazing and they're putting on weight. They're eating 3, 4 times as much as

642
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:27,910
Chaffee: you know, sometimes, right? It's like it's insane how much they'll eat. You know, one lady was

643
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:33,130
putting it more maybe not four times as much as me. But you know, good like twice as much as I would,

644
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:39,910
you know, and I'm not a small man, you know, I'm like at the moment I'm like 6, 3, 2, 3, you know. So

645
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:48,670
this little tiny little slender woman was even like 8,000 calories a day in rib eye. And that's

646
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:54,750
what she needed because her body was at such a deficit of of nutrients that she just needed this.

647
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:59,250
And she was putting on weight, but she wasn't like a massive bodybuilder. She didn't get

648
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:03,850
fat or anything like that. She was still very skinny at the end of the year, but she was eating like

649
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:09,950
Chaffee: 8,000 calories a day. And then that sort of tapered off when her body caught up. So unfortunately,

650
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:15,490
Chaffee: it's not, it's not like I can't give you a straight cramage amount. Your body will figure it out for

651
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:20,610
you. And you'll end up getting a couple hundred grams of protein a day. It's going to,

652
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:27,290
it's going to be well in excess of of what anyone would say. Oh, Graham, 1.2 grams, 2 grams

653
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:32,210
per kilo. Any of these sorts of things like you'll, you'll exceed that. Your body will definitely

654
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:37,950
exceed that, especially if you're working out a lot. Okay. I pops up this next question, Dr.

655
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:43,930
Shafin. I think it kind of, it goes along the same topic. If a person eats higher protein than fat

656
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:51,270
and is in ketosis when working out with the body prioritize using fat stores versus the protein

657
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:56,670
being converted to sugar. When they say protein being converted to sugar, I think that's a process

658
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:05,090
Chaffee: called gluconeogenesis. Yeah, it's not just your protein, though. You'll do that from fat too. So

659
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:09,970
Chaffee: it's not just, it's not just from protein in that. And the idea that if you have excess protein that

660
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,850
automatically get turned into carbs is not true. It's demand driven. It's not substrate driven.

661
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:20,110
It's not, you know, because there's, oh, it was just like that. Oh, yeah, that's just excess,

662
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:24,190
you know, food your all. We're just turning it in the muscle. No, no, that's not how it worked.

663
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:29,570
Your body does what it wants to do. And then if it has stuff left over, puts it in storage,

664
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:39,710
that's basically what's going to happen. You know, it's, it's hard to say, you know, your body's

665
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:50,390
your body's going to, yes, use some fat. But if you're eating far less fat than your body wants,

666
00:50:50,410 --> 00:51:00,330
Chaffee: you will start converting protein into energy. And it's not, it's not, you're not going to

667
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:05,390
Chaffee: trick your body into losing fat. In fact, a lot of times when you start doing that, you try

668
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:10,350
Chaffee: restricting the amount of fat that you're trying to, that you're eating. If your body's telling

669
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:14,850
Chaffee: you to eat the fat, it means eat the fat. You know, you're not going to trick your body into doing

670
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:19,270
Chaffee: this. Yeah, you can starve yourself into a smaller, you know, dress-off. Like everyone knows that.

671
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:25,930
But it will depress your metabolism and you'll plateau and you won't, you won't get any further

672
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:31,230
than that. And so you won't get like the ultimate gains. You know, it's sort of like, you know,

673
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:35,770
like that, taking a short cut and then you like you get there, but you didn't actually get

674
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,950
Chaffee: all the way there. You know, it's just, it's just, you know, it's like a deal with the devil.

675
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:43,910
Chaffee: You know, it looks like you're getting something good, but then actually it pulls you up short to a dead end.

676
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:49,850
Chaffee: So you can, you can slow down your metabolism and then all of a sudden you're not doing as

677
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:52,770
Chaffee: well, then when you start eating again, your body goes, like, okay, you know, we're going to store

678
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:57,290
Chaffee: this because you're telling your body that you don't have resources available. You know, what animal

679
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:02,470
when resources are available, when food's available, when their primary optimal food is available,

680
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:08,970
Chaffee: and they're hungry, they don't eat. When does that ever happen? It doesn't happen. So your

681
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:12,130
Chaffee: body doesn't know what you're doing. Your body doesn't know that you're trying to lose fat.

682
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,010
Chaffee: No, I know what he's doing. I'll help him out. It just sees, we're telling him to eat fat. He's

683
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:21,810
not eating fat. That means there's no fat available. We need to shut down. We need to store and

684
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:29,170
Chaffee: save resources. So you don't want to think about fat as a calorie source. You want to think of

685
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:34,890
Chaffee: fat as a nutrient. It is an essential nutrient. There are essential fatty acids that you have

686
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:38,950
Chaffee: to have or you get sick and you can die. There are essential fats available in nutrients that you

687
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:46,870
Chaffee: have to have or you can get sick and you'll die. Also, if you want to lose weight, you want to

688
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:51,590
actually prioritize fat as well. Think about it this way. Calories don't have weight.

689
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:56,730
Calories is a measure of heat energy. This is why I say they use less metric.

690
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:05,900
So when you eat things, you're eating matter, you're eating master eating atoms. That has weight.

691
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:13,460
They weigh in grams. So what's that equation? It's nine calories per one gram of fat, right?

692
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,840
And then four calories per one gram of carbs and protein. So people think, well, this is less

693
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:24,920
calories. So I'm eating less calories and all of these. My calories, no, it's not really how that works.

694
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,580
You'll end up eating similar amount and your body will tell you to eat this amount.

695
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,800
Chaffee: You could starve yourself but you're going to crash your metabolism. So if you're eating

696
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:42,960
Chaffee: fat and protein or don't eat carbs, think about it this way. If you flip that equation around,

697
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:51,260
Chaffee: now you look at it's one gram per nine calories or 2.2 grams per nine calories for protein or

698
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:58,280
carbs. So you're actually taking in less matter, less mass to get that energy. So in fact,

699
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:04,600
you're much more efficient getting your energy from fat than you would be from protein and things

700
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:10,160
like that. You're not just going to prioritize your fat stores. If you're eating enough fat,

701
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,660
if you're eating a protein, then you prioritize your fat stores. And your body says, hey, we're not

702
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:19,320
in a family. We don't have to store on to this. Let's raise your metabolism. Let's see what we can do here.

703
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:26,840
So, you know, another way to look at this or test this in yourself. And if you're burning

704
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,560
more protein than you want for energy and turning that into glucose, as you check your urea,

705
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,840
your urea and your B1, B1 and creatinine. But that starts going up. That means you're

706
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:47,640
converting a lot more amino acids into glucose and energy. Because you have to, you have to

707
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:52,240
leave off that amino group. That's that nitrogen group. You turn that into ammonia that turns into

708
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,460
urea. So urea starts creeping up. That means you're eating too much protein on a fat. And you're

709
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:03,240
using the protein as energy instead of the fat. And you can do that if you're overweight. It doesn't

710
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,120
Chaffee: matter. You know, if you have a lot of excess fat and you're eating weight too much protein,

711
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:12,420
Chaffee: you're about to use that protein as energy. You know, it doesn't need it, right? And so,

712
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:18,040
and it needs energy. And you're telling it you're in a famine and you're starving. So it's going

713
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,720
to say, well, we don't want to use our savings. We want to use that as little as possible. And we want

714
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:29,220
to use other sorts of means. So you're not going to outtrick your biology. You're not going to

715
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:34,240
trick millions of years of evolution. You know, just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good.

716
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:39,960
Chaffee: Lift weights, sprint if you can. And, um, and just give it time. You know, if this is, you're

717
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,400
Chaffee: not in a rush. You know, there are people that that lose hundreds of pounds in a year. And there's

718
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,980
other people that lose 40 pounds in a year. Or as people that don't lose any weight for six months or

719
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,260
a year. And then they start losing weight. Everyone's at different places. You don't want to force

720
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:00,340
this. Just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good. Don't eat anything else. Let your body do

721
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:05,400
Chaffee: this thing. And you'll be fine, you know. And just be patient. Let your body do its thing.

722
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,700
Chaffee: And like you'll get good results. The most important thing is your health. And then you're eating

723
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:15,600
the right things and give your body the proper nutrition for for optimal health. That's what you need

724
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:21,760
Chaffee: to do. So, you know, like you can trick yourself and take drugs and do it and take a

725
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,760
Chaffee: ejectal zempic and do all sorts of, you know, things to try to lose weight. And you'll lose weight.

726
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,400
But you'll really hurt yourself in the process. And you'll end up gaining more weight

727
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,360
Chaffee: than you lost at once you stop. So it's not the right way to do it. You know, slow and steady

728
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,920
Chaffee: wins the race. And the fact that matter is the most people doing carnivore eating more fat,

729
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:49,280
lose it, shit ton of weight. More quickly than anything else they've ever tried and it's consistent

730
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,760
and you can maintain it and you can keep doing this for the rest of your life.

731
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:01,520
Absolutely. Thanks Dr. Shafi. I'm going to have to rewatch this live a few times because your

732
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:09,100
answers are amazing and they're very scientific and there's been a lot of research and you've been

733
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:15,020
studying quite a bit. So I think these answers are awesome and I just want to pull this up because

734
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:23,480
I know what you do this all the time and you say thank you. We got about like five more minutes but I

735
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:31,140
appreciate the detailed answers. Dr. I'm on day 14 feeling amazing. This is double nickels and

736
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:36,260
keto $20. Thank you Dr. Shafi for all of you. You're a rock star. I appreciate all you do. He

737
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:44,800
absolutely is a rock star. He's like superman. He's Michael Jordan to me. Read a $5 super sticker. Thank you

738
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:52,240
very much. He says he could keep for the earlier question on protein fat and other $5. Just coming

739
00:57:52,240 --> 00:58:00,560
back here will take a few more questions. I had one ready. The next time I do this I'm going to be

740
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:07,100
a lot better at this everybody. I learned a lot from Dr. Shafi even when it comes to technology

741
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:14,720
sometimes. Just learned by doing I had to struggle through this the way you know what I was

742
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:21,160
Chaffee: starting out to. So here we go. When the samurai were hunting meat for their own consumption

743
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:27,540
Chaffee: and the imperial court tried to discourage rice growing peasants from eating it. You think something

744
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:33,700
similar is happening today. 100% there was the same thing everywhere in the world. The elites ate meat

745
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,920
in the peasants ate grains. That is what happened. That was in England. That was in India. That was

746
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:45,000
in everywhere. When the British colonized India they pulled them out of the forest. They stopped them

747
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,380
hunting because those were now the king's woods. The king's deer and they put them on

748
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:57,660
on fields. They had them growing grains and they paid them in grains and so they come overnight

749
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:03,190
changed their diet. They were always always Hinduism. No. Most people still ate meat.

750
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:11,960
In fact the original Brahman text was all about eating cows. It was all about how important

751
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:20,240
it was to eat cows. That sort of sacred, you know, colding the cow is sacred. It's probably

752
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,320
a holdover from that. It was such an important animal. But there's an important animal to

753
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,920
sacrifice and eat and share and feast and things like that and someone important came to visit.

754
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:39,120
Chaffee: You were required by the religious text to sacrifice a bull and your best bull and have a feast and

755
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:45,240
Chaffee: these sorts of things. That's exactly what's happening. They're trying to make this

756
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,840
the food of the elite again and they're trying to make people sick and dependent on the food

757
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,540
supply. If you have animals, if you raise animals, if you hunt in the woods, you're independent.

758
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,040
They don't want people being independent. They want people being deep-ended.

759
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:07,440
Chaffee: There's some weird stuff going on with hunting. There's some weird zombie plague going on with

760
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:14,240
deer. I think like Mark Zuckerberg went around and did a campaign and

761
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,460
inoculated a hundred thousand deer with what? For why? Well, for what reason?

762
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,260
But the hell do they need to be inoculated for against what? And all of a sudden you have this

763
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:29,160
zombie deer apocalypse where they have these are crazy neurological problems. And what's that

764
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:37,420
Chaffee: doing? Is that going to spread? Is that because of the inoculations? Is that what they were

765
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,240
Chaffee: going on here? Is that going to be transferable to humans? Is that transferable to other

766
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:48,720
deer or other animals? This is some scary stuff. And you know, people are desperately trying

767
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:57,420
to vilify me and they're desperately trying to stick the masses on just plant-based garbage that

768
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,800
we know is toxic to us. We're getting sicker and sicker than we've ever been in human history.

769
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:10,480
And and it is a direct result of the crap that we're eating. Absolutely.

770
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,360
One more quick thing. That was one of the major things. I was one of the major ways of keeping

771
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:22,760
the surf class, the peasant class suppressed and oppressed was you would you limited the meat supply.

772
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:28,140
Everyone knew how important that was and you just you kept it limited and that kept them

773
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:33,940
weak and subservient. In ancient in ancient Rome, they said, you know, when the plebians,

774
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:38,960
you know, which were the peasant class, when they would get, when they would get up and they

775
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,680
started getting ready to revolt. They didn't like how things were going. They would start handing

776
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,780
Chaffee: out bread and they'd put on a bunch of circuses and just distract them. Oh, look at these shining

777
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:51,840
Chaffee: lights. Same thing we're doing is like, hey, here's a free, happy meal. Here's a free Sunday and

778
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,840
Chaffee: come down here and oh, it's free, you know, going to have a free festival in the conference and

779
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:01,440
Chaffee: a carnival and all this sort of stuff. Same thing. But what people, so they said bread and circuses.

780
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:06,880
That's what people talk about. You know, just distract the plebians, the surfs, just bread and

781
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:12,160
Chaffee: circuses, bread and circuses, give them junk food, put them on Netflix and just just distract them

782
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,260
Chaffee: with shiny lights, right? That's what they do. That's been doing for thousands of years. What they

783
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:21,480
don't tell you is the other side of that equation of bread and circuses was they cut off the meat

784
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:29,620
supply and then they hand out a bunch of bread and then distract people with, you know, flashing

785
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:36,800
lights and lines, eating Christians and things like that. But that was part of it. They cut off

786
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:42,060
the meat supply. They know exactly what they're doing. People know this stuff for thousands of years.

787
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:51,460
And so, yeah, that's exactly what they're doing. Wow, crazy. Everyone, we're going to start

788
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:57,580
up and we're going to wrap this up because I've taken 45 minutes of Dr. Shafi staring at nothing

789
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:04,440
because I was a technology dummy this morning. And then we've been on, we've been on now for just

790
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,460
over an hour. So this has been phenomenal. I just want to, I'm just going to end with this one,

791
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,920
you can get all the nutrition from ribeye too. If you want to feel more better, have liver,

792
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:19,520
you can be in test science. I know Dr. Shafi, you don't eat any organs and you don't really

793
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:25,780
need to, I guess, being a lion diet carnivore diet. But I just wanted to pull that up because I was,

794
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:33,440
I was actually talking to my mother the other day and my mother's in her 70s. And, you know,

795
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:38,840
she's even fascinated by the diet that I've been doing, obviously. But I remember as an athlete

796
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:44,120
when I was in high school, especially as a basketball player, my calves would cramp up a lot.

797
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:50,420
And we had this thing we were taught to eat bananas, right, which to eat bananas for potassium.

798
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:57,300
So I'm sure my muscle cramps were a combination of, you know, inflammation, maybe not having

799
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:03,920
enough electrolytes, magnesium and potassium levels for the right muscle contractions. But everything

800
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:11,940
I'm learning about the ribeye steak and all the essential vitamins and minerals and nutrients

801
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:18,640
that are in a ribeye steak. I don't know what the actual number is, Dr. Shafi, but it's

802
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:24,840
something around like there's 10 times the amount of potassium in a ribeye steak versus a banana.

803
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:31,440
And I'd have to eat like 20 bananas a day to get my calves behaving the way I wanted them to behave.

804
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:38,160
Chaffee: So I think, is that somewhat correct? What I'm saying there? Yeah, I know me is way more nutrient

805
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,220
Chaffee: dense than all of this nonsense. I mean, it's just it's just all marketing, really. I mean,

806
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:47,860
Chaffee: and or just based in just flat out lies and propaganda, it's funny how many of these things are,

807
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:52,120
you know, I mean, did you grow up being told just eat carrots because it's good for your eyesight?

808
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:58,340
I did. Yeah, yeah, because it's old. There's a lot of care routine and that turns into vitamin A,

809
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:05,120
retinol. And that's really good for your eyes. And that's crap. That was, there's there's barely any

810
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,680
retinol at the end of the day. There's no retinol. It doesn't exist in plants. Beta care routine can

811
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:19,660
be converted, but it's like 120th of the beta care routine turns into retinol. It's very inefficient.

812
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,720
So you're really not going to get enough vitamin A. You'd have to eat about six pounds of

813
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:35,100
carrots a day to get enough vitamin A. And some people don't even convert retinol to or

814
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:41,580
from World War II, because we had like radar technology. We didn't want the Germans to know

815
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:47,340
Chaffee: that we had some new technology where we could spot planes before they were visible. And so we

816
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:51,780
Chaffee: we let it go out there that, oh, we're our pilots are eating a lot of carrots. So they get like a

817
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:55,660
Chaffee: lot of beta care routine and vitamin A. So they have better vision than they can see these guys way

818
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:02,720
Chaffee: far off. And it worked. People bought it. And then they didn't actually say that we were joking,

819
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,020
you know, because they, you know, they just they just left it, right? And you're just like the

820
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:11,520
food pyramid, you know, the government bought up all this grain because they guaranteed the

821
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,380
price of grain because they had to deal with the USSR to sell them grain and they have way too much.

822
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,500
And they just said, wow, we want to get this off our hands. And so they came out with recommendations

823
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,980
saying, hey, you need to eat 9 to 12 servings of grain. And they made the food pyramid. And that

824
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:29,960
was it that was not based on any of those recommendations. Even the recommendations at the time

825
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,240
were like, yeah, 3 to 4 servings a day. That's that's optimal. They're like, great, 9 to 12 it is.

826
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:40,480
And that's what they came out with, right? And um, and that was just to sell off the excess

827
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,900
surplus of grain that they had. And then they never walked it back. They just said, well, we're not

828
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:49,200
going to, we're not going to tell them that's what it was. So they just walked it, they just let it go.

829
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:55,620
Chaffee: There's been like that since the 50s, you know? So, you know, or 60s, 70s, you know? But anyway,

830
01:06:55,620 --> 01:07:02,480
Chaffee: long, long time, you know, decades. And, um, you know, and it was, it was just total crap. So,

831
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,300
you know, a stake is the most nutrient dense thing in the world besides, you know, liver and organs,

832
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:13,240
organs are really, really chock full of these stuff. Uh, I tend not to eat organs, but I do

833
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:18,360
Chaffee: have to do sometimes. There's, um, there's a South African dish or psych basically like minced up

834
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:23,220
liver with a bit of beef in it and it's wrapped with a suit, like fat and things like that.

835
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:27,320
I actually find I really like those. So I found a butcher here that would do without all the spices

836
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:32,760
and seasonings that they use. It's just the meat and the liver. And so I have those every now and then,

837
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:37,940
and that's fun. I don't think you need to do go crazy on it. There are a lot of people living

838
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:46,260
Chaffee: 20 years, 30 years. These guys, the Anderson's that have been, um, you know, for the last 25 years,

839
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:53,060
just eating rib eyes every single day, just rib eyes. And, um, raised, you know, handful of kids,

840
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:57,860
Chaffee: on the same thing, and they're just, they're all doing great. They look, you know, they look

841
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:04,760
Chaffee: younger now than they did 25 years ago when they started, you know, and, um, and like, actually,

842
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,920
I've shown their picture to, to people and they were like, they were like, yeah, well, that's obviously,

843
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:15,100
they're younger here, sort of put on weight here. It doesn't look as, as, uh, as fresh and

844
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:20,660
or faces, obviously, whether it is like, yeah, that's her 26, uh, when you're saying she looks older,

845
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:26,480
that's her 46 when you say she looks younger. It's crazy. It's crazy. The difference. Um, so you can get

846
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:32,820
almost everyone can get all they need from rib eye. Um, some people will have things like

847
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:38,140
MTHFR, they won't be able to methylate folate as well. And, uh, so just check your folate. You know,

848
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:41,480
if you're on a corner where I died, I think that's probably the only blood that you should check

849
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:46,420
is, uh, is your folate and, and potentially be 12 because if you're not methylating these

850
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:51,640
properly and you're not processing these properly, then, uh, you may just need a bit of extra

851
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,980
liver. And that's it, really. You just add in a bit of organs every now and then, but, you know,

852
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:59,860
you know, it doesn't have to be much keeping a proportion. You got to be able to cow, you're going

853
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:04,780
to eat that thing for the next year. It's got one liver, you know, so, you know, space it out. It's not that

854
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:10,840
big of a deal. And, um, and that's fine. So I still have a little bit of it, but, um, uh,

855
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:15,560
really only in the, uh, in the, uh, in the version of that, those, that little South African dish.

856
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:23,220
Sounds good. Uh, Dr. Shafi, um, I'm going to close this off, but I have this other question up here.

857
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:29,280
And I want this to maybe be answered on my, on our next live because I'm hoping you'll do another

858
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:35,800
one with me, Dr. Shafi. And what I'm hoping is I can maybe really try to encourage Peter and

859
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:41,100
Dante to be on with us because I think it's good to hear things from teenagers. I also understand,

860
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,880
I, I'm going to have to build up the courage for them to come on because, uh, when we're on

861
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:52,120
social media, I get it. All the other teenagers, uh, maybe judging them, right? So it's, it, they

862
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:56,220
need a lot of courage to get on here, but I, I would like to do my next live. And this question here,

863
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,700
like, can I continue taking, creating something while adapting the carnivore diet,

864
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:05,080
creating a something I know teenagers, even when I was in high school, um, and this is something

865
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,060
we could touch upon. I know, I kind of know the answer to this. You don't get enough

866
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:14,800
creating in rib eye snakes and in meat. You don't need to be taken this process garbage that

867
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,800
they're selling teenagers, um, especially how they're, where they're getting the creatine, um,

868
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,360
from, right, and how they're, how they're making that creatine in the supplement. So we could talk

869
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:29,600
probably more about that and how it, you know, it retains, it retains water in your body.

870
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:34,100
We could talk about more about that when we, when we're on with my sons, when we get some more,

871
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:40,200
this, this is what my wish was for today, Dr. Shafi, is that I really hope a lot of parents

872
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:46,580
of youth were watching this, a lot of parents of athletes were watching this. I'm looking at this,

873
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:54,080
there's 437 people watching right now. So I'm really blown away. It's pretty awesome. I thank all

874
01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:01,600
my subscribers, all of my, all Dr. Shafi subscribers. It's really the parents and the adults in the

875
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,760
world. My number one passion is youth and we, and I think a lot of us are, as our passion is

876
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:13,580
our youth and we want to change the world because we're kind of living in a cynical world where

877
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:20,960
we judge people a lot and we're being brainwashed by the wrong powers in terms of what we

878
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:27,100
need to be doing to improve ourselves. So I, you know, I, I started today with talking about

879
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:32,360
Michael Jordan and then I had people say in the chat here, Wayne Greski to stake every day,

880
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:39,080
every day, every day, every game to use to messy. There's actually someone right now in the soccer

881
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:45,040
world. His name is Irling Holland and Holland is the number nine striker. He's the Norwegian striker

882
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:52,160
place where Manchester State, he's in his early 20s. This, this young lad is constantly as an athlete,

883
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:58,020
trying to improve himself. And he is pretty much in, he pretty much emits to being about 80 to 90

884
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:04,560
percent carnivore. And he's grown. And I think I believe an inch or an inch and a half in his 20s.

885
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:11,520
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's Holland. And he wears, and he wears blue light glasses three hours

886
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,800
before bed every single night. So he gets a good sleep because he knows the importance of sleep.

887
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:21,300
Stuff like that, these are the types of people that we need, our, our children, our athletes,

888
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:27,760
are you looking up to. And um, Dr. Shafi, you're one of them too. So I just want to say thank

889
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,900
you from the bottom of my heart for being on with me today. And I'm sorry about all the technical

890
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:37,160
difficulties. Yeah. That's all good, man. That was a pleasure. And yeah, well, hopefully,

891
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:44,440
yeah, hopefully more parents get onto this and more kids are encouraged to try this because it's,

892
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:49,420
it's the best thing for them. They'll, they'll develop better than, then they would otherwise,

893
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:54,080
their brains will be bigger and stronger. Their bodies will be bigger and stronger. They'll be more

894
01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:00,020
athletic. They'll be happier. They'll be less, um, agitated, have less mental health issues. All these

895
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:04,740
things that you want for your kid, you know, this can be, they won't have major problems with acne

896
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:09,700
and skin issues and, and, you know, depression and all, you know, kids will get sad, you know,

897
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:14,680
being teenagers sucks in a lot of ways, you know, when you're dealing with a bunch of teenage drama,

898
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:21,260
but you can handle it so much better. Everything's just so much more chill. And so it's something

899
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:28,960
that that I think every parent would love the results of in their kids. Absolutely. Um, yeah,

900
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,440
thank you, Dr. Shafi, uh, for everything and thank all of subscribers and I wish everybody has a great

901
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:41,740
Sunday. Um, I know you're probably going to bed soon. Hey, Dr. Shafi. Yeah, it's 11 o'clock. So probably

902
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:48,920
I am so sorry. You need to go back. Yeah, that's all good, man. Take care. Thanks, everyone.
