1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,800
Okay, hi everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,600
I appreciate you still following along and hanging in there with us.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,240
So there we have the pleasure of having Dr. Anthony Chafey on.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,900
Dr. Chafey, thanks for joining the time.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,960
I'm not a problem, thank you for having me.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,520
You've got a really interesting background.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,920
I mean, in my research, I got stumps on, you went to university at 15.

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,540
Is that right?

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,640
By a 16, yeah, started at 16.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:35,900
Right.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,940
I can't.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,580
Super, that's not commonly a problem, right?

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,800
That's not completely away from my phone standing.

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,600
It's correct.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,720
Yeah, I know it's, um, you know,

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,580
there were different programs.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,320
I could my school.

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,600
You could take the SATs early.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,560
And if you did well enough,

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,260
you could start getting taken classes as a,

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,880
as like a non-metric related student.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,840
And you just sort of, and then you get sort of high school and

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,600
university credits at the same time.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,900
So, um, I would, yeah, I would go to university

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,900
during the day and then I go and play sports at the, at the school,

26
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,060
at the high school.

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,720
After that.

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,540
I don't want to think that.

29
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:08,540
Yeah, okay.

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,280
So good.

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,240
So you've been a bit of a brain box for a while then.

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,900
Um, so you're a medical doctor.

33
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,080
You're a neurosurgical registrar.

34
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,900
Um, over and perth, where you are.

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,260
Former professional rugby player.

36
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,300
And you spent years dissecting the science of human nutrition.

37
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,660
Most no, you argue that my own toxins are a hidden

38
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,920
factor in chronic disease.

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,420
And that a strict animal based diet may be the key to unlocking

40
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,300
best blood health longevity and performance.

41
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,820
So, do you mind just walking us through your background education and

42
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,500
handle you ended up believing what you believe about nutrition and

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:40,740
balance?

44
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,300
Well, so when I, when I started university, I always wanted,

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,320
I was always interested in the sciences, map and science where I was my,

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,160
my favorite subjects.

47
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,640
I was wanted to be a doctor.

48
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,120
And so I was looking at my prerequisites.

49
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm for premed and, um, and I was also an athlete.

50
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,220
And so I also wanted to know what was the right nutrition.

51
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,100
You know, how to be as healthy as possible.

52
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm, you know, I never separated those two things that that eating

53
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,900
health, lean, living a healthy life.

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,600
Obviously, I was going to make you healthier and as a doctor.

55
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,820
You want to know how the body works.

56
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,440
You want to know how to keep people as healthy as possible.

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,920
Using diet and lifestyle measures and not just medications and things like

58
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,860
that to treat symptoms.

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,840
So that was always something that that I thought was important thing to know about

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,860
as a as a future doctor.

61
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,380
And took nutrition classes took biology,

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,780
botany, cancer biology, all these sorts of things.

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,300
And, you know, was getting the sort of the standard, you know,

64
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,660
sort of training that that everybody else gets.

65
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,320
You know, that bad vegetables good.

66
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,440
You know, maybe limit me to know that sort of stuff.

67
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,220
Clustrel is a bad thing or whatever.

68
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,720
It's all just a sort of a trope now, but.

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
When I was taking cancer, but I never bought that meat was bad for us.

70
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,900
You know, I always knew that, you know, he was rape ex predators.

71
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,900
And then we just we've always evolved eating meat.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,180
There was there were really important things in me.

73
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,480
You know, I think it was thankfully my, my family.

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,780
You know, studied nutrition.

75
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,280
And like there was a nutritionist of Del Davis 100 years ago.

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,340
We have her books for like generations in my family.

77
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,860
And they were, you know, so that was those sort of things that we, we more followed.

78
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,880
And, and, you know, if you were going to like cook vegetables and things like that,

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,660
you would read vegetables.

80
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,600
You wouldn't eat them raw.

81
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,180
You'd prepare them in certain way because they had chemicals.

82
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,640
And then like a del Davis even said, you don't ever eat raw spinach because they have oxalates,

83
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,700
which would be very harmful.

84
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,180
We know this in Western medicine, 75% of kidney stones are calcium oxalates stones.

85
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
So these oxalates from plants get in bind to the calcium in your bloodstream,

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,300
form stones and can block up your kidneys.

87
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,880
But they do a lot of other things in your body too that are deleterious to your health.

88
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,120
And a del Davis 100 years ago was saying, well, this is how you, this is how you traditionally eat spinach.

89
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,240
You don't just eat it raw.

90
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,380
You, you poach it or cook it with milk or dairy.

91
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,700
So cream milk or cheese.

92
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,420
So you're going to think of that the classic dishes with spinach, like spanacopita,

93
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,140
which is fed a cheese with cooked spinach with fed a cheese,

94
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,200
cream spinach those sorts of things.

95
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,980
And that calcium would leach out and neutralize the oxalates so that it would say for it eat.

96
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,960
So a group knowing all that stuff.

97
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,960
And, but at the same time, you're sort of told, you're supposed to eat this balanced diet.

98
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,640
You're supposed to have carbs, veggies, and meat, and all that sort of stuff.

99
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,660
And that gives this balance.

100
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:43,160
And then I had a professor of cancer biology who basically told us that this wasn't exactly true.

101
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,220
That plants have a lot more defensive chemicals than we really realize.

102
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,020
That we know this intuitively, you get lost in the woods.

103
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,800
You can't, and you run out of food, you can't just eat any random plant.

104
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,880
Most of them will get making very sick or even kill you.

105
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,380
So, you know, we understood about this concept of edible plants and inedible plants,

106
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,300
ones that were so toxic that you would die if you ate them.

107
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,200
Or you get very, very sick if you ate them.

108
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,700
You know, socrates died from drinking hemlock, right?

109
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,960
So, this is, you know, just, you know,

110
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,360
North American water hemlock half a leaf will kill you from intractable seizures,

111
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,200
but then one or two minutes, right?

112
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,300
And you can't really reverse that.

113
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,460
It's extremely toxic.

114
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,820
So, these are things that, that I knew growing up.

115
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,500
This is things that I knew studying botany, that every living organism has a defense mechanism.

116
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,260
And plants because they're stationary, they can't run away or fight back like an animal can.

117
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,820
Their main defense is chemical in nature.

118
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,040
They have about a million different defensive chemicals that we have categorized classified and even named.

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,800
And so, this professor was basically pointing out that just because something is an edible plant,

120
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,420
doesn't mean that it doesn't have these toxins.

121
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:06,240
And just because they're not fatal toxins, doesn't mean that they can't cause a build-up of

122
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
carcinogens, so that these things could cause stress to the system,

123
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,120
damage amount of conduit, cause DNA damages, and then eventually precipitate cancer.

124
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,200
And he said that, this is back in 2000, that

125
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,100
Brussels sprouts had 136 known carcinogens, and that mushrooms had over 100.

126
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,500
That spinach and kale, lettuce, celery, cabbage, cucumber, broccoli,

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,200
every single produce item that you've ever eaten.

128
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,320
We were given lists of these, and they had dozens if not over 100 known carcinogens in them.

129
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,540
You know, we know this intuitively as well, right, because we eat things like tomatoes,

130
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,300
or we eat avocados, or we eat grapes, and we think, oh, no, those are fine,

131
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,280
but they actually will kill cats and dogs, right, because there are toxins in them.

132
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,920
It's just that we have more defenses towards those toxins than cats and dogs do.

133
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,300
And so all plants are toxic.

134
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,760
It's just that certain animals have evolved the ability to detoxify them to a greater

135
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,300
or lesser extent, but even herbivore, strict herbivores that only eat plants,

136
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
only eat very specific plants.

137
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,220
So a cow can't just go around any random plant, that eat very specific ones,

138
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,140
because they've had that, that's their evolutionary niche, they can eat those plants.

139
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,660
They don't have to compete for resources.

140
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,880
That's a very common theme that assuring animals will evolve to be able to handle

141
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,740
the toxins in a certain plant, such as koala with eucalyptus.

142
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,700
There's almost nothing else to eucalyptus besides the koala, but the koala doesn't

143
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,580
need any other plants either.

144
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,780
And so that's their evolutionary niche, and that's their, you know,

145
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,400
they have that sort of protected resource.

146
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,420
So we were very taken back by this, who's saying that there was all these toxins,

147
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,660
all these carcinogens.

148
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:01,360
They're quite abundant that there were about 10,000 times the amount of toxic elements

149
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,400
in vegetables, and then the pesticides we spray on them by weight,

150
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,100
and that that was hundreds of times we're likely to cause cancer,

151
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,260
then the pesticides we spray on these things, which are sprayed on 2B toxic

152
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,180
and fatal to animals that insects trying to eat them.

153
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,760
So we can't, you know, and the plants are worse.

154
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,420
And this was a work from Professor Bruce Aims in the 1980s when you see Berkeley.

155
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,640
Aims then concluded that obviously these pesticides aren't that bad,

156
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,400
because obviously fruits and vegetables are good for you, because that was the

157
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,940
wisdom of the time, because if fruits and vegetables are good for you,

158
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,120
and they're way more toxic than the pesticides we spray on them,

159
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,960
therefore the toxic pesticides can't be that big of a deal.

160
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,480
Well, that's an assumption, but the data show that there's 10,000 times more toxins,

161
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,200
in the plant than the pesticides, and that plant toxins were hundreds of times

162
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,720
we're likely to cause cancer than the pesticides.

163
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,960
So that's what the data actually showed.

164
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,940
And so our professor was basically very much in that camp that these plant toxins were not a good thing.

165
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,860
And so he ended up basically saying that he didn't eat salad or vegetables,

166
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,820
and he wouldn't let his kids eat vegetables, because in his words,

167
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,480
plants are trying to kill you.

168
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,040
And why would you eat these things?

169
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,240
Why would you step into that defense?

170
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,480
You know, it's like getting into a pen with a raging bowl,

171
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,940
and pissing it off.

172
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,800
You're asking for trouble, right?

173
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,720
That bowl doesn't want hunch you and kill you in each of you,

174
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,520
but if it feels that you're a threat, he will absolutely try to kill you.

175
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,620
And that's what plants do as well.

176
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,900
They have no problem with you dying if they get to live.

177
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,400
I mean, latex, we use latex clothes.

178
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,340
Latex is a sap that when an animal choose a particular plant,

179
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,980
it starts releasing latex that's so tacky.

180
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,620
It's like a glue and it includes their mouth shut,

181
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,920
which is a pretty elegant way to stop something from eating you.

182
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,580
It was glued their mouth shut, right?

183
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,860
And they can't chew you, but the problem is they can't eat it all.

184
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,860
And they often die from starvation or from getting eaten because they can't,

185
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,680
they can't get food after that.

186
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,780
So again, the plants have no problem with you dying if they get to live.

187
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,560
So that was in my, I think I was about 20 years old,

188
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,980
and I just stopped eating plants altogether.

189
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,960
I was like, right, not doing that.

190
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,660
And I just defaulted into just eating meat and eggs.

191
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,080
I felt better than I ever have in my entire life.

192
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,660
And it wasn't actually until five years later when I was 25,

193
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,800
and I was playing rugby in England, actually,

194
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,160
that had new braves we were talking about earlier,

195
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,980
that I sort of fell off of that,

196
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,840
because the meat that I could get there,

197
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,160
you know, wasn't sort of the same as I could get in the U.S.,

198
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,900
a lot of it was breaded.

199
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,420
I even found there was just going to, like, a sainsbury or something like that.

200
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,760
I found out later that they could like inject the meat with water

201
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,880
to like bring the poundage up so it could charge you steak prices for water.

202
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,240
And whatever is happening, I couldn't make these things brown.

203
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,420
They would cook all the way through and they'd just be Korean sweaty.

204
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,720
And like, what the hell is going on?

205
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,840
Why doesn't meat cook like it doesn't America?

206
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,180
And then you go to a butcher, you're fine,

207
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,620
but you know, that stuff that I was getting wasn't good.

208
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,440
And so I ended up defaulting over,

209
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,860
like, okay, well, I'll just get this,

210
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,500
this, these chicken drumsticks and things like that,

211
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,780
that are already pre-cooked because this is just,

212
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,040
and this is just getting stupid,

213
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,060
but they had bread crumbs on it and I was like, okay,

214
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,580
well, you know, is that going to be a problem?

215
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,840
I mean, dose makes the poison.

216
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,040
There's not that much of it.

217
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,340
Maybe that's not that big of a deal.

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,220
And yeah, it's true, dose does make the poison,

219
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,880
but the dose is really small.

220
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,100
They'll don't realize that.

221
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,160
And I felt that my athleticism and my endurance

222
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,860
and my ability to recover was seriously impacted by that.

223
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,160
And I remember thinking, like, why don't I feel

224
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,140
it's just superhuman amazing as I have before.

225
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,200
You know, I'm not working out.

226
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,820
I'm not pushing myself 25 now.

227
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,740
I just old and I just dying now.

228
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,220
And so that's what I just chalked it up to.

229
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,800
I was like, I guess I'm just old now.

230
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,220
Yeah, it's 25 is it, you know?

231
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,460
But at 25, I felt like a super hero,

232
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,180
25 and a half, I did not.

233
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,660
And I didn't put two and two together until,

234
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,960
you know, 12 years later, 13 years later,

235
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,240
when I was just back from doing humanitarian working

236
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,720
Bangladesh.

237
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,460
And then came across your information that just showed pretty clear

238
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,400
that humans actually are carnivores as a species,

239
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,820
that's just the kind of animal we are.

240
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,740
And I looked back on the early,

241
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,520
my early 20s when I felt like an absolute superhero.

242
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,460
I couldn't get tired.

243
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,520
I couldn't run out of energy.

244
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,740
I had this massive athletic potential.

245
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,040
And I never felt like that again.

246
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,740
Even at 25 and a half or 26,

247
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,180
27 still playing professional rugby.

248
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,400
I did not feel like I did at that time.

249
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,620
I could never figure out how to get back to that.

250
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
And then all of a sudden that I clicked.

251
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,320
It was like, that's what I was doing.

252
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,880
I was eating as a carnivore and we are carnivores.

253
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
And that's our biology and all animals.

254
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,560
If you feed them something that they're not designed to eat,

255
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,580
they don't perform as well.

256
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,420
They don't feel as well.

257
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,100
They get sick.

258
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,380
They get diseases.

259
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,680
They get autoimmune diseases.

260
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,560
They get diabetes.

261
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,420
They get cancer.

262
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,900
They get all those same things that we get.

263
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,840
But only when eating an incorrect diet.

264
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,440
And so that just sort of flash for me and I said,

265
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,100
okay, right?

266
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,820
I knew it.

267
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,060
I knew plants were trying to kill me.

268
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,300
Get rid of these stupid things.

269
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,660
And I just cut them out.

270
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,680
And at the time, I was eating just green veggies.

271
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,840
And lean meat because I was trying to lean up for.

272
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,300
For rugby, try to get back into rugby.

273
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,460
And it wasn't working.

274
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,600
I was fully inflamed.

275
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,560
My back hurt all the time.

276
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,600
I joined sort of all the time.

277
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,820
I was retaining water.

278
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,960
I couldn't lose weight.

279
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,920
Didn't feel good.

280
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,760
Didn't have much energy.

281
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,780
And then when I just cut out the greens and started eating a lot more fatty meat.

282
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,680
And really went went focused on the fatty as cuts.

283
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,960
That because at this point I had already,

284
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,680
you know, come across research showing that the whole idea about saturated fat and cholesterol was

285
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,860
completely hocome.

286
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,160
And it wasn't absolutely not true.

287
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,560
And it was not the cause of any disease or poor health outcomes.

288
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,000
Certainly not cardiovascular disease.

289
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,000
And so I started eating more fatty meat.

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,060
And I cut out all the veggies.

291
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,160
And I, I massively improved my health.

292
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,680
I started losing weight immediately.

293
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,120
I also was water weight.

294
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,860
Information is drained out of my body.

295
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,560
And within two weeks, I felt so good.

296
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,980
I said, right, it's time to go back and play some rugby.

297
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,720
And that's what I went back out for the 38 years old.

298
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,980
I went back out and started playing for the professional team in Seattle at, you know,

299
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,660
Seattle C bulls.

300
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,540
That was the first year.

301
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,140
And so I started playing with them, getting back into it, getting shape.

302
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,760
It was feeling great.

303
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,580
I ended up hurting my knees.

304
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,740
So I couldn't actually play out that season.

305
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,700
But my body felt amazing.

306
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,580
And, you know, it was, and so I got really interested in that.

307
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,380
And I started looking at this from a medical perspective that human beings are biologically

308
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,140
carnivores, but we are not eating and living as carnivores.

309
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,560
And so is that having a negative affected impact on our health?

310
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,880
Is that the cause of all these chronic diseases that we're seeing nowadays?

311
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,360
And so I started digging into the research.

312
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,180
And spending, you know, I had some time off at that point.

313
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:11,520
So I was just still taking a bit of time off after coming back from Bangladesh before I started my new role in Australia, actually.

314
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,700
And I, so I had time.

315
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,700
I was spending eight to ten hours a day just reading studies and looking things up and asking questions and trying to find

316
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,600
Literature to answer those questions.

317
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,200
You know, if this is a problem, if plants are a problem, then we should see this.

318
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:34,100
You know, if autism is related to diet and from not eating meat, you know, we should see, you know,

319
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,280
or do vegans of vegetarians have higher rates of autism.

320
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,820
Yes, they do, actually.

321
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,160
And Texas A and M found that there was actually a causative link between carnitine deficiencies.

322
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:54,740
And vegans of vegetarians and the development of autism because you require carnitine for proper development of your neurons and your brain and proper functioning of the mitochondria.

323
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:04,920
And we, we make carnitine, but and so it's considered non-essential amino acid, but at the same time, we don't actually make enough of it all the time.

324
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,860
70% of people can make enough, but that means fully 30% of people almost want 30% of the planet.

325
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:18,820
Don't make enough carnitine and need that from their diet and carnitine only exists in animal animal proteins.

326
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:27,880
So if you're raising a kid vegan or vegetarian and they're not getting enough carnitine, their brain will be able to develop properly if they don't make enough of this stuff.

327
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:40,840
So things like that, and I just started asking questions and reading studies, and I just found that there's this entire body of evidence and literature that was not even mentioned to us.

328
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,360
And it's not even a medical school or beyond because as I realized later, it did not.

329
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:56,180
Well, it didn't have a marketing budget behind it playing in simple union. You have a drug that comes out and some sort of mechanism that you can assign a drug to, you know, you make these drug companies make billions of dollars off of that.

330
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:06,100
And so they can, they can spend millions of dollars on a marketing campaign and getting that into literature, getting it into the textbooks, getting that into medical schools and things like that, getting it on the news even.

331
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:20,180
And whereas just these these studies on ketogenic diets showing that this can reverse diabetes, it can reverse auto immunity that it can reverse heart failure that it can reverse Alzheimer's or at least improve these things.

332
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,540
Those don't have a product behind it, so they don't have a marketing budget behind it to push this out there, but it's there.

333
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:32,240
It's there for anybody to see there's a massive body of literature that we just haven't looked at.

334
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,700
And so the more I found the more supported this idea that we really shouldn't be eating plants, we really should just be eating fatty meat.

335
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,360
And I remember thinking, I'm like, okay, well, everything I'm looking at is just coming up stakes.

336
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:54,120
But, you know, maybe I don't want to be a victim of confirmation bias. I don't want to just be stalking in an echo chamber. Okay, what am I missing?

337
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:05,040
You got all these vegans of vegetarians out there. You got doctors and researchers of PhDs saying that that no meat is the way to go. Okay, so I'm I'm seeing only me just the way to go. They're saying no meat is the way to go.

338
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:16,660
So which one is it? What am I missing? What are they seeing that I'm not seeing? And so I went and started looking at at their talks at their lectures and asking them questions and looking at their blogs and writings and literature and all that sort of stuff.

339
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:23,700
And I just found that everything that they've been basing in soil was essentially came down to the idea that saturated fat cholesterol causes heart disease. It doesn't.

340
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:34,680
Or just misunderstanding about chemistry or just flat out wise, like, trying to say that humans evolved as herbivores, which is nonsense. There's no evidence to even suggest that.

341
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:44,040
And, you know, you can't even get B12 from plants too. So, and there's dozens of other essential nutrients that only come from meat that you can't get from plants.

342
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:59,160
So the idea that we evolved as herbivores is is honestly laughable, but that's what you see. You see people just completely making things up or basing basing their assumptions on this this faulty dogma about red meat and saturated fat.

343
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:09,840
And so even that helped confirm for me that that this was the way to go and since I've been applying that to my patient population over the last seven years or so.

344
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:18,780
I've just seen untold improvements and massive benefits and people's health. It's absolutely, I mean, it looks miraculous.

345
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:31,040
I mean, it sounds far-fetched because this is reversing diseases that are still to this day considered irreversible, like congested part failure, like diabetes, like auto immunity.

346
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:39,000
The auto immunity just melts away. That one's the easiest one because what I think of the auto immunity is it's really just an exposure issue. It's not an actual disease.

347
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:52,400
No, this one isn't disease. It's that they're being they're being afflicted by some sort of these exterior toxins either from plants or agrochemicals or whatever that this is actually triggering that immune response.

348
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:07,400
So I'm not the first one to think that I found papers going back to the 1990s from a doctor freed 1991 who argued that the body actually can't attack itself. And I was certainly taught that in immunology postgraduate immunology back 20 years ago.

349
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:15,940
And and he was saying that for the body to actually attack itself it has to meet certain criteria, which are not that have never been shown to have been that.

350
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:29,760
But every single one of these criteria to listen to this particular immunological response are all satisfied by the known effects of plant lectins in the body, lectins being toxins that plants make to defend themselves.

351
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:44,000
So I'm not the first person to think that it goes back even further in the 1800s. There's a doctor, Jay H. Saul's Barry, who actually was curing auto immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, crones, ulcerate colitis.

352
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:53,040
You know, all the others as well by putting people on a pure beef and water diet and that was and he again thought the same thing. This is a problem of digestion.

353
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:05,980
You were eating certain things. It was causing harmful chemicals inside the body. It was causing these reactions. And you eliminate those out. You do a 30 year research project on this. It wasn't just like an overnight assumption that he made a 30 year research project on this.

354
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:17,780
And then he started treating people with just beef and water diets and he was reversing rheumatoid. He was reversing crones and ulceraclides and there's even literature on this that randomized controlled trials and crones disease patients.

355
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:26,560
Where if you remove carbohydrates and fiber, that can keep people in remission from crones disease without medication for over four years.

356
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:41,020
And contrasted with the control group that didn't remove carbs and fiber and they didn't remission. They couldn't even say remission one month without medications. Right. So we already know that there's a massive impact and role that that food has to play.

357
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:49,920
So that sort of as a causative nature you take away something and all of a sudden the problem goes away. That means if you bring it back and the problem comes back and that's a cause and effect relationship.

358
00:21:50,600 --> 00:22:01,340
There's another study with crones as well that put people on elemental diet, which is sort of a very processed diet, sort of like a shake, but has all the macro micronutrients you need and nothing else.

359
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,960
They're generally key to genetic because they're for kids with epilepsy largely.

360
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:20,900
And. And so when you put some one of crones disease on this on this elemental diet, they found that that's a better treatment for an acute flare up of crones disease.

361
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:31,080
Then prednisone or prednisone steroids, right, which is the gold standard right just shuts down your immune system and your body can't can't cause this damage.

362
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:44,380
And so just not eating certain things is a better treatment than steroids in the gold standard, right. So that again suggests a cause and effect relationship between things that we're eating and auto immunity.

363
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:56,820
So applying this to my patient population has been has been very rewarding has been very staggering. I have you know, I've been working as a neurosurgical registrar, sort of transitioned into a prevented medicine practice and.

364
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:12,300
And where I'm able to apply this diet and lifestyle sort of interventions and actually reverse diseases, which is crazy. So we're and we're going to be, you know, publishing a lot of our results we're getting ready to publish a case series for 10 to 12 patients who have actually reversed.

365
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:22,300
A multiple sclerosis and not only from a symptomatic point of view, but you know, there's a neurodegenerative process de mile and 80 disease that damages your brain and spinal cord.

366
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:31,120
But not only have they, you know, somebody's people are bedridden and wheelchairs and things like that and a lot of people are leading basically normal lives now somewhere still in transition.

367
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:41,000
But the most interesting part of that is that on MRIs, their lesions are actually shrinking, which has never been reported ever not with any medication, not with any any sort of intervention.

368
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:55,340
That I that I've ever heard of. I haven't come across anything in the literature. I think this will be a first to publish actual MRI before and after is showing that there's actually resolution of lesions not even just stopping progression, but actually shrinking the lesions.

369
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:09,340
So that I think that's a first as far as I know anyway, and if it's not a first it's an early and as pretty dramatic so you know, I found that that's it's one of the more.

370
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:23,000
Chaffee: I've ever found for my patients that it's certainly better than anything I've ever been taught and it goes back to topocrates, you know, left food be that medicine and medicine my food, right, and and then there's another one sort of attributed to him, but you know, who knows.

371
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:32,720
That said before before you try to heal somebody first asked them if they're willing to give up that which is making them sick, you know, understanding that we're naturally healthy.

372
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:42,040
We should we should be healthy by design and so if you're sick and your body's falling apart, it's it's something that's in your environment something that you're either doing to yourself or being done to you.

373
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,700
And if you figure that out and you remove that, it's just like a toxic exposure, letter poisoning, etc.

374
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,500
If you're able to just eliminate that out, your body should get better on its own and that's what I'm trying to do.

375
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,200
Unbelievable and so many super clear. Thank you for that and so many jumping on points.

376
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:07,120
My first being, I can hear it in my, uh, she produces this podcast, my partners, well, I'll always I can hear her question might it already, which she'll have in here.

377
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,460
Okay.

378
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:17,920
Which is what about this idea of a little bit of stress is a great thing for us, the sort of Zeno or me to affect from different plants and compare.

379
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,680
And specific plants, how do you think about that?

380
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:40,280
Well, the thing is is that again, there's about a million different defense chemicals, so which ones are hermetic at what doses and are they at the same doses is all the other toxins in that same plant that you're going to get right so let's say that there was.

381
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:48,060
You know, I've talked some that gave a hermetic effect, you know, you know why every people say that there's certain certain plants or anti inflammatory.

382
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:58,280
It's sort of an argument of hormesis, which is, you know, some of these things like, you know, tumor and things like that trigger your body to.

383
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:09,220
Pretty glue the phyome, which is a really strong antioxidant and so they think, oh look at this, it's your body's releasing all these great antioxidants, okay, that's great, so you have this anti inflammatory sort of effect.

384
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,980
Why is it making the glue to the phyome though, it's making the glue to the phyome to try to detoxify all the poisons in the tumor, right, so that's like.

385
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,980
So, you know, almost so easy to point.

386
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:36,380
Sorry, it's in response to the negative effect of the tumor that that's it that's exactly it so you know, we know that these things are toxins because because our body tries to detoxify them, right, and that's what the glue to find on is doing.

387
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:45,380
And so your body is, so we say that, oh look, you have this anti inflammatory effect, your body is creating more who to find on, but is doing that in order to.

388
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,440
Address the toxins that you just brought into it. Okay, so is that a traumatic effect or your body just responding to a toxin.

389
00:26:52,440 --> 00:27:02,200
Is there an overarching reduction in inflammation on top of what it gets from detoxifying the poison that you just gave yourself maybe maybe not.

390
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:09,500
But no one's proven that no one's actually shown one way or the other that this actually has a beneficial effect past that.

391
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,700
You know, the thing with hormesis is that.

392
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:25,720
It's the definition of hormesis is this is something harmful and if it's too much, it's toxic and can hurt you or kill you and so you have to keep it below that level, right.

393
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:37,940
Chemical hormesis is a very different thing than like exercise from me says, you're stressing your body, you're exercising and this gives a benefit in the long term, but there are good reasons for that.

394
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:51,720
And with the chemical sort of the chemical issues are there really more the responses you get or like this this detoxifying effect like an anti inflammatory sort of effect, which is trying to.

395
00:27:52,360 --> 00:28:08,860
Uninflame D inflame you from the things that you just did yourself, but also tolerance, right, so you could say that alcohol has a traumatic effect because it helps you build up a resistance and a tolerance to alcohol, but is that giving you an overarching benefit.

396
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,560
To other things as well, or that only helping you if you drink copious amounts of alcohol.

397
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:30,180
The argument that I've heard people say is like, yes, well, these plants have toxins, but you know, you want to keep a steady supply of these toxins in there so that you that you build up this this resistance to them so that if you meet them, you know, later on, that you're not going to get hit full force with this.

398
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:41,820
That's like saying you should do heroin every day, just in case you, you know, build up a tolerance to heroin just in case you get hit with heroin six months down the road and it, and it makes you, you know, crazy high and you can't control yourself.

399
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,640
That's a bad argument.

400
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,660
You have to know and we're, and we're, we're talking about a plant toxin being traumatic.

401
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,180
Hey, you have to prove it that it's traumatic.

402
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:01,240
You have to prove what dose of traumatic because we all agree that traumatic substances past a certain point are toxic and harmful.

403
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:10,700
So you need to be very clear and delineate what is the target range of hormesis. So what the, what the chemical is, what is traumatic.

404
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:18,460
What dose is it traumatic? And then because this is coming in a plant that has thousands of potentially toxic chemicals in it.

405
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,780
You have to understand, okay, is there, are you getting a net negative from these other toxic effects.

406
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:36,340
Even if this were traumatic and not only that, maybe you're saying, okay, well, maybe they're all hormetic, okay, so you have to then list out all the different toxins that are in the plant.

407
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,080
You have to find out if they're hormetic or not.

408
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,660
You have to find which doses are traumatic or not.

409
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:49,040
And then you have to see, okay, how many leaves of spinach can I have to get hormesis versus toxicity.

410
00:29:49,820 --> 00:30:00,800
And okay, if I want more pieces from the oxalates and in the, in the spinach fine, what's how many leaves are hormetic and then at that same number of leaves.

411
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:12,120
Am I getting a hormetic effect from the other toxins in the spinach or are they too high or too low or whatever, so it's, it's sort of a throw away line.

412
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,300
It's one that's used a lot.

413
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:22,320
And it sounds good at first the same. Well, these, yes, there are toxins, but these are good toxins, these are toxins that are good for you and there's like, but not.

414
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,360
You know, your bodies not, these plants are not trying to help you out.

415
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:41,220
You know, digitalists was not formed in Fox Club millions of years ago, so that, you know, 70 million years later, these, you know, hairless apes that might develop heart disease because of their lifestyle.

416
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,240
Bad lifestyle choices.

417
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:57,840
You know, that they might help them with their, their, their heart disease, right? No, they, they created this so they could stop the hearts of, of the animals trying to eat them, sorry, am I, am I cat saying hi, will naked cat.

418
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:09,660
And, you know, so that's what they're doing this for, they're trying to kill you, you know, if you take, if you take maybe 50 micrograms too much digitalists, you're dead.

419
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:20,620
Right, so we can measure this in millions of a gram for therapeutic doses. That's the hormetic dose. So you could talk about hormesis in the sense of medicines.

420
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:28,580
But medicines are only beneficial during certain conditions. Like if you have heart failure, you're congestive heart failure, for example.

421
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:38,620
And you take, you know, 50, 100 micrograms, one of your doses of digitalists that can help increase the contractility of your heart.

422
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:55,760
So this is a poison that is trying to kill you and stop your heart. But at the same time, if you take this in micro doses in millions of a gram, it can actually help you under certain circumstances. So that could absolutely be an example of hormesis if you are sick.

423
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,040
If you're not sick, then it's not going to actually improve your health at all.

424
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:11,140
But you're talking about micro doses. And when you're talking about in a plant itself, again, that digitalist, you don't know the dose. You don't know exactly how much is in it. You don't know the conditions it was it was made in.

425
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,540
So you're not going to understand how much is in there. So you don't know if you're getting the hormetic dose or the toxic dose.

426
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:28,460
And it comes with hundreds potentially thousands of other chemicals, are they good or better, are they hormetic or they in the toxic levels. So the hormetic, the hormetic argument.

427
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:40,500
Basically, if someone wants to make that, they have to then show, okay, which chemicals are hermetic, what is the dose? How many grams of that vegetable? Can you have? What about the other chemicals?

428
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:49,460
Or are they hormetic at the same dosage? And you just eat that exact amount of spinach or lettuce or whatever, then you're going to get hormetic across the board.

429
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,160
Something like that's very unlikely. It's very unlikely you're going to get any of that.

430
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,420
But you know, people generally just say that and say, well, hormesis, and then they don't, and then they walk away from the discussion.

431
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:06,540
I think I'll look at me. I've proven this and sometimes a stressor is is more beneficial than harmful. It could just be harmful, right?

432
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:17,360
And so you have to be under strict conditions. And I know when I've ever spoken to who, even people that lecture on hormesis that ever been able to address that.

433
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:28,820
Okay, well, I mean, yeah, very well put. I'm of the, you know, I get to speak to bring people like yourself a lot on this podcast and, you know, I know you've interviewed Dr. Thomas E. Friedam.

434
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,020
He's putting it down like a steam and you're very plugged into the metabolic health world.

435
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:43,720
And through this, I come to believe that most diseases or most chronic diseases and metabolic in nature and that keto on door to that like optimal metabolic state.

436
00:33:43,720 --> 00:34:00,760
It seems that carnival is well, but if you were to track the blood bit measuring glucose levels or ketones of someone in strict clinical keto, maybe for, you know, cancer reasons or whatever versus someone or a carnival diet, the blood, but look quite different.

437
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:09,960
But mechanistically, what do you think is going on with carnival and how does that lead to sort of better metabolic health all around for all these different point disease?

438
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,420
So, so what blood markers in particular.

439
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:37,440
So, I mean, I, I've tested thousands of people's blood work over the years, the thing thing to remember is is that a carnival diet is a ketogenic diet. It's a subset of a ketogenic diet. It's just a plant free ketogenic diet goes one step further.

440
00:34:37,440 --> 00:35:01,960
You know, we understand in ketogenic and ketogenic nutrition, ketogenic metabolism, that there are certain things that cause harm metabolic harm, such as carbohydrates, sugar, alcohol, these sorts of things to range or hormones in such a way they raise our blood sugar, which is toxic to the body elevated blood sugar causes direct damage to the vasculature and our body damaging the blood vessels, damaging the blood supply to every organ tissue in the body, causing end organ damage.

441
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:09,360
It's a number one cause of kidney failure, number one cause of adult blindness, number one cause of heart failure, it's number one cause of amputations.

442
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:20,160
Right, because this is damaging the vasculature is damaging the blood supply. That's high glucose. And so in order to protect the body from that high glucose hyperglycemia, your body elevates your insulin.

443
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:25,400
And that would be all well and good if the only thing that insulin did was lower blood sugar, but it's not.

444
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,140
It actually is involved in hundreds of other processes in the body and the brain.

445
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:39,380
And when you elevate that artificially with, um, by elevating your glucose, your blood sugar, you're elevating that for all these different effects. And you're actually causing very serious metabolic harm.

446
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:49,800
So that is a major precondition to chronic disease is is all training our metabolic state or hormonal state. There's so many things. I mean, it's very interesting.

447
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:57,380
People look up the different effects that insulin has in the body's wild. There's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of things. They're extremely important.

448
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:07,480
It lowers testosterone levels and net. It lowers estrogen levels and women. So bleeding calls a PCOS polycystical variance syndrome and women, which is the leading cause of impertility.

449
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:16,700
When that's insulin resistance, insulin blocks the conversion of testosterone and estrogen and women making them completely hormonally on balance and infertile.

450
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:28,320
It, um, when you have elevated insulin, it, it downregulates the insulin receptors on the light excels and the testicles, main is making men make less testosterone.

451
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:38,720
And then when you reverse that and you resensitize your, your lighting cells to insulin, all of a sudden with less insulin, you're creating more testosterone.

452
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:48,180
And the list goes on. I mean, it blocks the action and production of growth hormone, which is very, very important for obviously growth during puberty.

453
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:58,320
Since the agricultural revolution, people have shrunk on average about five inches, right, and that could possibly be to this, these hormonal actions from growth hormone.

454
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:05,640
We're suppressing the growth hormone during puberty and you're just not growing as tall, right, but you need growth hormone throughout your entire life.

455
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:15,900
So there are a lot of problems that that carbohydrates, hyper insulinemia and hyper, you know, hyperclicemia cause directly on the body.

456
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,220
So that's a big first step, carnivore diet addresses that so does a ketogenic diet.

457
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:33,020
You could eat a more lean protein diet and not being as deep ketosis as someone who's really aiming for crazy high ketones, but you are in that same metabolic state.

458
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,820
And that's the important thing is that your insulin is low and you're able to access your fat store.

459
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,920
We call it a ketogenic state. I think it's a bit in this name. It's really just a fat burning state. The burning carbs, you're burning fat.

460
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:49,860
So if your insulin is high, it blocks the body's ability to break down fat for energy.

461
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:57,160
And when the insulin goes down enough, now you can now you can access your fat stores, which is the main energy storage in your body.

462
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,620
A 65 kilo individual with only 6% body fat.

463
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:11,040
Maximum carb loading can only store about 2,400 kilo calories of energy in glycogen in his liver and muscles for his whole body.

464
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:21,660
But that same 65 kilo individual with only 6% body fat. That 6% body fat has over 35,000 kilo calories of energy.

465
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:29,160
So that's actually the main storage form. When you're in that fat burning metabolism, you have access to that, which is a lot better when you're in athlete as well.

466
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:35,940
Because you don't have to keep sucking down gels and sugar packets. You just constantly are in tap tap into your energy levels.

467
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,020
And you completely regenerate your glycogen as well. That's been shown in human trials and elite athletes.

468
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:52,100
So a carnivore diet is just taking one step further. You're in touch with your fat cells, your insulin's low. That's the main thing.

469
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,300
It doesn't really matter how high your ketones are because long term ketosis.

470
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:10,520
You get more keto adapted and your ketones go down anyway. You have the in you who are eating extremely high fat diet. I think that 50% by weight of their diet can be fat, which is 90% plus calories from fat.

471
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:26,260
And their ketones can be 0.3.4, right?

472
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,600
Matters that you can tap into your fat stores. That's why I think is a bit myth name.

473
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,320
But it's sorry.

474
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,780
I was just saying for me personally, that's where I've always thought, well, because I read it really well to just stay connected.

475
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,380
And I feel, I've let it really great. I feel awesome.

476
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,480
I do notice that sometimes my SHGB goes quite high if I don't eat enough cap.

477
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:55,700
So that's one question few is, the people who say, oh, if you go pure carnivore, your SHGB goes through the roof.

478
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:02,700
Mind understanding, it's just a calorie deficit problem as opposed to a diet itself.

479
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:14,100
And then, secondly, I loved to understand, because like you, you've played rugby and the nutritionists, you know, I feel like garbage if I eat, you know, load of carbs and like for rugby game.

480
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:19,800
But if I actually stay a ketosis at the time, I didn't know about carnival then. I feel way better.

481
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:30,380
So from a point of view, what would you say to the athlete on listening to this being like, well, no, I've got a carb load for all my different things.

482
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,900
I mean, if we start with the end, you think, go back into the Atlantic stuff.

483
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,220
Yeah, so I'm sorry, I missed that last last thing, just so much.

484
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:49,540
Yeah, so if you just address like the hormonal impacts of going out of all maybe like fluctuating and then go and just, you know, how this has,

485
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:58,460
the effect of performance being in that. So the thing is, I have actually not seen because I tell people eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good.

486
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:03,160
I'm not telling people to go into a core deficit or not telling people to under eat, nor to lose weight.

487
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:18,400
Weight loss is better achieved by eating optimally and normalizing your hormones and keeping your insulin blood sugar and leptin and check and getting, you know, keeping track of your own hormonal metabolic state.

488
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,440
And then the weight just flies off and especially be exercising.

489
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,620
So I have patients that have double even triple their testosterone levels. I've had professional athletes that have been patients of mine who have doubled their testosterone levels.

490
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:42,600
And so whatever you want to say about the advantages or disadvantages are being ketosis, you cannot tell me that it's a disadvantage to double your testosterone as a competitive male athlete or even female athlete.

491
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,980
But, you know, it doesn't turn women into men. It just optimizes everybody. That's the main thing.

492
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:57,900
And so I have never, I've, I've heard the, the accusation that without carbohydrates being ketogenic, your SHBG will go up.

493
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:06,400
I have never seen it happen in practice. My SHBG has been 34 for the last seven years. I've checked my level. It just has never changed.

494
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:18,660
And so I at 45 years old, I maintain without TRT or anything like that. I maintain healthy testosterone levels of a 25 year old.

495
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:35,200
And that's what I see in my patients. I 50 year old, six year olds, 70 year old patients who when they go on to a ketogenic carnivore diet, they have this massive swing in their testosterone and hormones in general and health in general up to that healthy 25 year old level.

496
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,260
There's a number of reasons for that. One testosterone is made from cholesterol. Now we're normalizing cholesterol.

497
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:49,240
We're not trying to beat it out of your body system. When you go into ketosis, you're going to fat burning metabolism. You have to transport fat to your liver and how do you do that.

498
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,160
You do that in carrier molecules called LDL and HDL and they go up. And so if you, oh my god, you're going to die because of all this cholesterol.

499
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:03,640
No, that's natural. It's a metabolic state change. If you just fast for five days, you're ACL and LDL go up as well because you're running on fat. You need to transport the fat. It's pretty simple.

500
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,000
And because now you have more cholesterol, you're not eating these plants.

501
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:20,700
You're not having these plant sterols that are plants version of cholesterol that suppress your own production of cholesterol.

502
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:32,180
Now you're actually making a normal amount. Your body's making the amount of cholesterol that it wants. Now you have more substrate to make testosterone with.

503
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:38,800
You're also not eating plants that have phytoestrogens and hormonal disruptors that will block your testosterone.

504
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:47,380
We'll boost your estrogen. Soy has more phytoestrogens than the birth control pill. I just have seven or eight times as much estrogen as the birth control pill.

505
00:43:49,220 --> 00:44:00,000
And things like, what was it, flax seed, flax seed, three ounces of flax seed has actually more estrogen than a fertile woman makes in a day.

506
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,980
Right. So it's the last thing you want to, if you want to correct your hormones for a man or woman's going to really mess you up.

507
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:17,020
Another thing is you're going to get more bioavailable nutrients like zinc zinc is required for testosterone production. Again, your insulin resistance is going to correct on a ketogenic carnivore diet.

508
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:26,620
And so your your lighting cells are going to be more sensitive to your insulin. You're going to have a higher signal to boost testosterone production as well.

509
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:41,160
So all these different things and there's more play into increased testosterone production. I see this across the board. I'd say probably good 90% of my patients male patients will have a massive increase in their testosterone levels.

510
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:55,320
I, I really almost never see the SHBG go up. You know, a couple times I've seen it where people is their total testosterone will go up jump up into that 25 year old range.

511
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,920
But then their SHBG will sort of come up with it and their free testosterone will say about the same so they don't go down.

512
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:10,060
But then as their bodies getting more metabolically sound and you know, it's is be sort of the same thing as someone injects testosterone.

513
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:25,520
And you have this big massive jump up and testosterone suddenly that can elicit a rise in your SHBG as well. So people that inject testosterone actually find that after a few months their SHBG starts climbing up and they have to inject more and more and more to get the same results.

514
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,420
Right, so there could be something like that that your body, all of a sudden just making so much more testosterone, your body is as well.

515
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:38,760
I can't hold the hell with that and has this sort of the same response. And then I see as they become more metabolic, they healthy more hormonally healthy.

516
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:46,380
The SHBG starts coming down, their total testosterone stays up and their free testosterone starts coming up as well. So that's what I typically see.

517
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:57,360
I did a whole talk on ketogenic carnivore athletes at a medical conference and that's available on YouTube by that name and people can go into the whole whole science behind it.

518
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:06,340
I mean, even just being able to access 35,000 kcal of energy in 6% body fat, that's already a massive, a massive improvement.

519
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:22,240
There've been multiple high level studies in humans in top elite athletes showing that being in ketosis actually allows people to have better performance.

520
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:30,880
So it, it's, that has to take a caveat with that. So that's when you get properly fat adapted.

521
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:37,040
So there's that idea of keto adaptation where your body gets turns on different genes so that you utilize ketones for energy better.

522
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:44,360
That can take months, but it takes at least a couple of weeks to start being able to use those ketones properly.

523
00:46:44,360 --> 00:47:07,140
So there's, there's studies by a professor Tim Nopes that are crossover trials randomized crossover trials in recreational athletes that they put them in a keel group randomly selected me into a keel group or a carb group and let them adapt for six weeks and they had these athletic performances.

524
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:19,600
They ran a series of 800 meter runs and people say, well, they just have this built up muscle glycogen left over, you know, that's, that's nothing clever to say, okay, let's just keep running these until basically there's no way they'd ever had to have any glycogen left.

525
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:29,460
They just did 800 effort 800 effort 800 effort 800 effort 800 effort 800 effort 800 effort 800 the carb athletes had to keep sucking down sugar gels and gatorades and things like that to maintain their energy and performance.

526
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:41,180
The keto athletes just cruise the whole time. Then they had a two week washout period and then they swapped the group. So it was a crossover trials that keto group became carb group, carb group became keto group given six weeks again.

527
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:49,380
And ran the test and again, no drop in performance whatsoever the keto group just ran they didn't have to drink gatorades or anything like that. So that's it six weeks.

528
00:47:49,380 --> 00:48:03,360
Then you had McSweeney who did a study was at 2017 2018 2018 I think and he took elite level world class level ultramarathon runners and iron man athletes.

529
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:11,280
They self selected into keto group or a carb group and and then they got keto adapted for three months they had this for three months.

530
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:21,220
And so then they had three tests they had a hundred mile run that is six second sprint and then a critical power test like a power lifting test right.

531
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:32,840
So all the different ways you can athletically move your body so explosive anaerobic power sprinting and then long distance you know endurance running okay.

532
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:38,380
And they found that the ketogenic group outperform the carb group in all three fields.

533
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:46,740
And the sprint and the critical power test came to statistical significance so you can really only say the hundred mile they beat all the guys on the hundred mile run.

534
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,020
But you can only really say that that was a trend that didn't reach statistical significance so.

535
00:48:52,020 --> 00:49:05,600
Yeah, may have been a fluke who knows but they did beat them the other two came to statistical significance so when people say well yeah this works for endurance athletes but it would never work for rugby well no sorry the sprinting and power lifting that's actually came to statistical significant.

536
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:14,620
And as a well I don't see anybody in the tour to France doing keto well actually is Chris Froome who's like a three time three three four time winner of the tour to France he does keto.

537
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,180
Right.

538
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:22,500
Yeah, yeah, he does get his ton of them ton of people that they do this some of the top higher man that place ultra marathoners.

539
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:33,380
They do they do kids generally do even full carnivore right rugby teams half the New Zealand all blacks have been carnivore for like eight years nine years.

540
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,040
I spoke a new a couple of all like they've reached out to me on on social media.

541
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:49,120
And you'll comment on one of my videos and say hey keep up the good work I really like it and I was like okay that's really cool hey I heard that a lot of you guys you know like the Frank brothers we're only all blacks.

542
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,800
They've been you know keto at least keto if not carnivore for years.

543
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:05,460
You know one of them have just got resigned at 38 to three year deal with the crusaders right so these guys are still playing world class level rugby at nearly 40.

544
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:13,800
And that's I think that's largely to do with being ketogenic you get a lot of along jabby you get a lot of reduced information.

545
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:25,980
You know even arthritis one of you arthritis for seeing damage and cartilage when we take these samples out of the joint we're actually seeing glycation damage that damage from the glucose and the sugar damaging the cartilage and breaking it down.

546
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,700
And so you're not going to get as much joint break down and degradation.

547
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,860
When you're in a state of ketosis long term you're not going to break down your joints you're just going to last longer you're going to be an athlete longer.

548
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:49,700
And and so yeah so a lot of the old blacks are a lot of the Australian rugby teams are joining this now quite coopers openly carnivore sunny bill Williams is open the carnivore.

549
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,000
There are.

550
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:03,160
The entire rugby teams like the pendant panthers were the top rugby league team and you'll probably since the origins of the league here in Australia they won like four or five grand finals in a row.

551
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:11,980
And they came out after they won last year and publicly said yeah we're all doing this animal based carnivore diet right we just feel like superheroes.

552
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:31,120
I have a friend of mine just sports medicine physician who is is very fond of the ketogenic carnivore diet for his athletes and he's he's worked with entire rugby teams and converted the whole team over and one of them was at the bottom of the league they're actually thought that they were going to get relegated and they had no significant personnel changes.

553
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:41,860
He got them on to ketogenic or even full carnivore and all of a sudden they're in the playoffs right so they went from almost being relegated to going in the playoffs and no significant.

554
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:48,640
You know personal changes and things like that they they were beating teams at on paper ever thought these guys are going to get smoked.

555
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,800
You know.

556
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:58,920
So there's quite a lot of of of traction on this the key the iron man runners and ultramarathon runner they figured this out a long time ago and they've been doing this more and more.

557
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,560
So I think that is there's a lot of benefits from being in ketosis from a performance point of view.

558
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:19,160
But also from a longevity point of view because you're not going to eat all these plants and I have the gut issues all these sort of sort of issues not eating sugar all the time not getting prediabetic a lot of these athletes you stop at these if they studies.

559
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:26,480
Who's better the keto group of the car group the keto group almost invariably has like has a pre diabetes or even diabetes.

560
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,980
You know that's not that's not going to keep you in the game all that long.

561
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:35,280
There's another study by a vol like in thinning the faster trial in 2016.

562
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:49,800
And you know they say that for high level for high level athletic performance you have to eat carbohydrates because above you know zone two cardio 55% of the O2 max you just start burning carbs and that's true if you're in a carbohydrate metabolism.

563
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,220
And you cannot access your fat stores to oxidize fat.

564
00:52:54,220 --> 00:53:04,700
But if you're in a state of ketosis even just immediately they did this in the supernova trial and they basically said hey look these guys aren't are burning a lot of fat over 92% VO2 max.

565
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:09,480
But you know their performance has gone down, but that's because they tested them in the first week or two.

566
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:17,820
They didn't give them a chance to adapt right but when you give them weeks to adapt all of a sudden there's no drop given three months to adapt there's a there's an improved performance.

567
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:28,780
So when you're in ketosis this is multiple studies have shown this vol like show this as well in 2016 the faster study that when you're in a state of ketosis.

568
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:37,660
These guys were in state ketosis for a month they were the ultimate marathon runners iron man runners they've been doing this for years some of these people average 22 months.

569
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:44,420
And they found that they were burning fat at over 90% VO2 max.

570
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,040
And only then were they using some of their glycogen and blood sugar which they were replenishing immediately.

571
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:57,600
And they found they did muscle biopsies they just three hour run and they did muscle biopsie before after and then three hours after the run after the recovery.

572
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:07,360
And they found that the ketogenic group had an ketogenic in carb group had the exact same muscle glycogen at all three stages before after and then three hours after recovery.

573
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:16,680
Even though the carb group was carb loading and then drinking gels and sugar during the three hour run.

574
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:26,860
And then drinking a whole bunch of sugar and eating carbs after their recovery they still had they still did not replenish their glycogen any faster than the ketogenic group.

575
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:34,620
So anyway you slice it from an energy perspective carbs are absolutely not the answer and if you if you're adapted long enough.

576
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:40,220
You're going to start out performing yourself and and your other competition.

577
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:51,800
Okay, so I'm going to give us a go. I mean I'm long explored keto and I've done next for a number of years and things like this but I've heard you say that you actually have to be quite.

578
00:54:51,900 --> 00:55:03,880
You know the premise is quite strict so so where well the boundaries of like how you would start with the patient doing this you know is do fast with it what types of meats are best are eggs allow things like this.

579
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:13,960
Well you know it depends if you're just if you're if you don't have any sort of serious health issues like auto immunity and things like that you have a bit more you know a bit more.

580
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,560
Anyway, right.

581
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:25,260
Some of the auto moon issues they really have to stick to just red meat and water if they want best results the even eggs can can trigger auto immunity especially if it's.

582
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:32,360
Being fed corn and soy and things like that because some of those lectins and toxins will actually get into the egg or get into the chicken and the meat and of the pork even.

583
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:39,960
So you want that room in it meat that will that's the best is a room in it meat that or just wild meat that's pasture raise eating what it's supposed to eat.

584
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:50,980
But barring that you want the room in it meat the the cows in the chicken or the cows in the lambs goats benefits and things like that that have that four barrel stomach.

585
00:55:51,820 --> 00:56:02,520
That can ferment and break down all these toxins even if food that they're not designed to eat so they can just break down they can be a better filter for these toxins and get more nutrients and nutrition out.

586
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:08,940
So those are the best if you're just if you're not in that category where you're very very sensitive to these sorts of things.

587
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:16,760
Then just eat any meat that you enjoy that makes you feel the best and that you have access to and kind of forward and so and if you like eggs that makes you feel good.

588
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,020
I mean try to get past your raised eggs that they are more nutritious but.

589
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:31,920
You know eggs are fine eggs are totally fine eggs are great I mean it's it's honorary meat because it's just has all the the precursors to turn into an animal right so it has all the things that you need to be.

590
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,320
animal to grow and build an animal.

591
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:44,340
And so you just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good you do that as many times the days your body's telling you if you're training a lot and you're working out a lot especially if you're trying to put on muscle or not lose weight.

592
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:50,820
Then you want to you're probably going to need to eat about twice a day to get enough nutrition so that you you can satisfy your workload.

593
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:58,060
And you want to get one to two grams of fat to one gram of protein so very high fat diet moderate protein.

594
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:07,760
Your body has a limiting capacity to absorb that and that's determined by your bile you'll ever make a pile but it only makes a certain amount slow to produce.

595
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:15,460
And so if then you store that in your go all that and you concentrate that down so that you can have a big dose of it in one go when you eat you fatty meal.

596
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:26,280
Once you run out of the bile you it's really hard for your body to digest and absorb fat it's very difficult you only do about 10% of this something it's usually like medium chain triglycerides.

597
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:36,240
The rest of it is going to go out it's just not going to be able to be absorbed and so it goes out in your stool is that's what keeps your stool soft that excess fat to your body can absorb so if you're getting hard dry stools.

598
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,060
By definition you're not eating enough fat.

599
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:48,280
If you're getting loose stools you could be eating too much fat now there's other things that can cause loose stools coffee tea artificial sweeteners usually in the coffee or tea.

600
00:57:48,280 --> 00:58:05,280
Now even magnesium supplements or medications like metformin for example all of those can have a mild active effect and when you get rid of fiber even if coffee never gave you the runs before and now you get rid of fiber which actually causes obstructions it causes slowing of the motility in your gut doesn't speed things up.

601
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:13,900
Slow things down and so that coffee is probably offsetting that so you're going regularly fine now you've gotten rid of that blockage and now it's too much okay.

602
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:27,760
So if you're only eating meat and only drinking water then you can gauge how much fat you're getting by your stools and so if you're getting soft stools even if it's once or twice a week because you absorb 98 99% of the meat that you're eating.

603
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:35,460
And so you just aren't going to have all that much waste as long as it's soft then you're getting the right amount of fat.

604
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:47,340
If you adding coffee and you have loose stools what the loose stools are probably from a coffee may not be from the fast you can actually hide under eating fat if you're drinking coffee or tea or some of these other sorts of things that can cause loose stools.

605
00:58:47,340 --> 00:59:06,740
So you want to try to have a clean slate to sort of see how much that you're getting but if you're ever getting dry stools then by definition you're not eating enough that it's hard to pass that sort of thing rocky hard stools yeah have to eat more fat even if you're eating 10 times more fat than you ever thought was healthy if you need more if you're getting dry stools you need more.

606
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,740
You know so I with my patients if they.

607
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:21,920
If they want to sort of ease into it I always start them out okay just get rid of junk food obviously whole foods focus on meat nags that you eat as much meat nags as you want get rid of the carbs.

608
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:27,920
You know go ketogenic start that off right now if you want some vegetables just you know try to have.

609
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:37,460
You're cooked cooked cooked you know and cooked in ways that we traditionally would make these things don't have a much of raw veggies that will have all their toxins available right.

610
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:49,300
And mix them up don't don't have the same ones every single day because you have this toxins build up and so you'd have all the meat nags that you want and then two fifth size servings of non-starchy vegetables.

611
00:59:50,420 --> 01:00:07,120
For the whole day right but then you want to phase those out and if people are able to just just cut everything out it's sort of easier to do that because you don't have to think okay well what veggies can I have and how much carbs they have and what about this just eating meat reading eggs and.

612
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:12,800
There's nothing else you know it's an easiest way of eating in the world you know exactly what you can eat you know exactly what you can't eat.

613
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:17,880
Yeah there's no there's no gray area there's no question about it just you eat meat you eat eggs and that's it.

614
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:28,080
You did any time of the day or night you don't have to like not eat before bedtime because you're worried about an insulin spike that will suppress growth hormone and melatonin.

615
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:35,220
Right because you're not getting an insulin spike you get a mild insulin bump with your protein but not much.

616
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:49,340
You eat as much as you want and as that's literally the case as much as you want as much as your body's telling you not as much as you I want to eat this whole buffalo okay we may want that but your body doesn't want that you eat until your body tells you to stop.

617
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,220
So if you're eating meat and it tastes good your body still wants it you have.

618
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,360
Chemical receptors in your stomach that actually track up your vagus nerve to your brain and your brain can actually track.

619
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,200
The macro micronutrients that are sitting in your stomach your your body tracks.

620
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:08,120
Nutrients not calories and so.

621
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:17,720
Your brain can actually see the nutrients that are in your stomach and so it says okay we need more of this we need more of this meat still tasting good meat still tasting great.

622
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:25,620
And then all of a sudden you're by saying actually we've got a pretty good amount of this we can slow this down all of a sudden it doesn't taste is good so first by is going to taste amazing.

623
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:32,880
And then next by is going to taste amazing amazing good good okay all right and you're going to get to a point we're just sort of taste like cardboard.

624
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,040
Even though it's the same piece of meat cooked at the same time the same conditions it's still warm.

625
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:50,100
And so why is that tasting different why it tastes like the best thing in the world with the first bite analysis kind of this because your body knows what the nutrients are in there and they're saying that's it and that's how.

626
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:59,040
In nature animals regulate how much they don't have a dietitian or a calculator to figure out their macros and and how many calories they're getting in.

627
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:11,420
Interesting to call it with a lot of calculated figure out its calories for the day they just eat and there's something in them that tells them when to stop and that for us is taste is probably for them to.

628
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:23,340
But so you eat until it stops tasting good and you do that as many times during the day as your body wants to do finish a whole big plate even if it's more than you think you should ever you ever even one time and it tasted good.

629
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:30,440
And that last bite you need to go make some more especially if you're working out because you need that you may need more nutrition.

630
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:38,420
So okay when it comes to what you're cooking you'll be in I mean my team all of oils out coconut oils out.

631
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,660
There it is.

632
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,360
Things like that.

633
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:40,800
Gee.

634
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,780
It's good.

635
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:42,580
Gee is better.

636
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,060
Gee has a higher smoke point.

637
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,760
And then a grass fed talo.

638
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:47,940
Grass fed geese great.

639
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,440
Grass fed talo is great.

640
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,720
Duck fat goose fat.

641
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,840
Lard animal fats.

642
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,900
Especially things that are that are solid at room temperature.

643
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,060
But it's going to have a lower smoke point.

644
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:07,300
So in the unless you're cooking sort of a low low temperatures sort of like eggs or something like that or sauteing something.

645
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,340
Lightly.

646
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,060
Then then you probably want to use something besides butter.

647
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,460
Even you know coconut oil has a higher smoke point too.

648
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,520
It's solid at room temperature.

649
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:21,260
It's not going to oxidize as like the olive oils or canola oils are which is not good.

650
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:22,580
If people were wondering.

651
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,920
But the problem with coconut oils it's it's a it's a plant oil.

652
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,500
It's just going to have the plant sterile.

653
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:35,240
It's a plant cholesterol and and and that's going to interrupt your normal cholesterol cycles in your body as well.

654
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:40,400
And and so for that and you know a few other reasons I don't I don't use those.

655
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,680
She want to use animal fats.

656
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,440
And typically the best to cook with would be things like ghee and talo.

657
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,380
Also that's super clear.

658
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,860
Well, I'm going to give you a go.

659
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:51,640
I'm sold.

660
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,860
Thank you so much for spending the time.

661
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,460
And I appreciate it's late in Perth has beat you all day.

662
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,580
So many questions and things.

663
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,360
But I do know you have a pretty extensive YouTube channel which I'm pretty sure.

664
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,060
People who you know have questions can go and find the answers there including myself.

665
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:12,460
The last one from me is anyone who wants to dive deeper into this obviously got your YouTube channel.

666
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:17,660
You mentioned the talk you did about athletic performance which will put on the.

667
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:18,620
In the show notes.

668
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,240
I'll just recommend or point people towards your Q and A you did with the.

669
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,820
Dr. Dagestino and Angela pop I think it was on the.

670
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:29,180
In the shoot platform which is great.

671
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,740
Any other books.

672
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,880
Any other resources that people can you know really want to dive deep web.

673
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,420
Where can they go.

674
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,200
Yeah, well, I have a website.

675
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,140
It's just.

676
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,480
Dr. Anthony Chafi.com and I have a lot of resources on there.

677
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:47,280
I have a lot of links for papers and studies and links other videos and things.

678
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,360
So look up cholesterol.

679
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:53,020
It's going to have a whole bunch of studies and videos and links and things like that as well.

680
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,080
So you can sort of jump into that as well.

681
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,660
And I will give a lot of resources as well.

682
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,560
You know, if you want to sort of look at these things, I mean, you can you can go back and start reading the books from.

683
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:07,880
Major researchers major clinicians who have figured this out.

684
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,300
150 years before any of us did.

685
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:17,980
Dr. J. Saul's very wrote a book called the relation of alien meditation and disease back in the 1800s after you did a 30 year research project.

686
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,320
On the optimal nutrition for human beings, just living with the Native Americans or just eating.

687
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,500
You know, meet from the bison things like that year around.

688
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,400
They were extremely healthy.

689
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:29,320
You'll live me 110, 115, 120 years.

690
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:30,460
Which sounds far fresh.

691
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:35,240
But actually was taught in genetics 20 years ago that genetically we are designed to live 120 years.

692
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,320
So that's exactly how long we should be living just naturally.

693
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,240
But yet we're dying 40, 50 years earlier and we're calling that a normal life span.

694
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:44,940
It's not.

695
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,120
We're actually being poisoned by something. We're actually being held back.

696
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:53,340
And you don't die 50 years early unless you were sick for 30, 40 years leading up to it, right?

697
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,260
And that's typical what we're seeing now.

698
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,060
There were more books since then.

699
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,900
There's Dr. Weston A. Price.

700
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,700
There's a dentist who noticed in the early 1900s that people in pre-agricultural communities.

701
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:09,180
When they were producing to more Western diet that their face weren't developing properly.

702
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,940
Their jaws weren't developing properly.

703
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:17,520
The teeth were coming in crooked even though their parents and even their siblings had perfect dental arches.

704
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,800
Perfect jaw formations.

705
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:23,120
And he figured out that there's something to do with animal nutrition.

706
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,740
They weren't getting enough animal fats.

707
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:30,240
And so he started supplementing him with cream and butter, milk animal fats.

708
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,900
Meat things like that. He actually reversed this.

709
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:37,160
These crooked teeth and dental misdevelopments and things like that.

710
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,040
And he wrote a whole book on that, which is pretty fascinating.

711
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,220
There's a Western, Western, a price and a price bondage foundation.

712
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,960
Now, continuing on his work.

713
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:47,540
There's even, there's a book called Strong Medicine.

714
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,220
It's a doctor in the 1960s.

715
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,460
You're basically talking about, this is how you stop all these diseases.

716
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,000
These are all these diseases are caused by eating the wrong thing.

717
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,380
And you just, you eat meat.

718
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,920
You cut out all this other, all these plants and other stuff.

719
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,580
You get out in the sun. You sleep properly.

720
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:06,000
You form proper human connections with your family and friends.

721
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,180
And then that's basically going to take care of most diseases.

722
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:15,440
There's even a study of a book in 1975 by Dr. Walter Vocland called the Stone Age Diet.

723
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:16,960
That was just that.

724
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,760
It's just argue that, look, humans are carnivores.

725
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,540
It's just what we've been, we've been apex predators for 2 million years.

726
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,880
This is what we need for millions of years.

727
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,760
It's what we're biologically adapted to.

728
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,080
And basically, if you stop eating plants, my profession as a gastroenterologist,

729
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,420
ceases to exist. That's what he argued.

730
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,580
And so there are all these sorts of books.

731
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,760
It's not just me saying this.

732
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:40,880
People, doctors and researchers have been saying this exact same thing for hundreds of years.

733
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:47,900
It's just it's been papered over by by very wealthy industries that profit by the

734
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:55,920
trillions of dollars every single year by having us eat plant-based junk that has

735
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,420
extremely high mark up causes us to get sick.

736
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:04,860
And then we have to spend trillions of dollars a year on medications and treatments to try to mitigate

737
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,740
those harmful effects.

738
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,420
Drug companies don't look for cures.

739
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,780
They never have.

740
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,620
And they say this.

741
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,140
They, in fact, they've had leaked internal memos, like from Goldman Sachs saying,

742
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,220
you know, is carrying someone of a disease, a viable business model.

743
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:26,080
The answer of course was no because if you kill them of the disease, that's it.

744
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,680
You treat them once and it's over.

745
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:33,160
But if you treat their symptoms and allow them to live with the disease, then you can sell

746
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,260
them this medication for the rest of their life.

747
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,800
And so that is what their model is.

748
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:43,820
And in fact, Goldman Sachs sent an angry letter to a company called Gilliat that actually

749
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:47,540
found a cure for hepatitis C, which is a very good thing to do for the world.

750
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,880
And this is what doctors used to do.

751
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,020
They actually tried to better the world, better humanity and cure disease.

752
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:52,800
It actually did that.

753
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,780
My great grandfather was a doctor in late 1800s, early 1900s.

754
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:59,160
And that's exactly what he and his colleagues tried to do.

755
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,700
And then the whole medical profession got completely corrupted by these industries.

756
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:11,440
And Goldman Sachs sent a letter to Gilliat saying, you messed up by curing hepatitis C.

757
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,740
You never cure a disease.

758
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,040
You only treat the disease.

759
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,340
You get a better treatment for the symptoms of the disease.

760
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,000
And then you can treat them the rest of their life.

761
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,940
You know, basically if you want our investment money, you're not going to do that.

762
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:23,580
I'll show you again.

763
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,920
You're going to look for symptom control.

764
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,260
So that we get a better return on our investment.

765
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:29,920
We're not trying to save the world here.

766
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:30,800
We're trying to make money.

767
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,380
And so fine, that's their profit incentive.

768
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,560
And so they're not going to look for cure.

769
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:37,880
So that's fine.

770
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,100
Let's just not look to them for the cure.

771
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,580
We've got to figure it out ourselves.

772
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,940
And a lot of people would figure that out before us.

773
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,400
And again, it's just been papered over.

774
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,840
And meet has been vilified.

775
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,880
And as pushed, I mean, that's a whole other thing.

776
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:57,200
You know, meet was vilified and that was vilified in order to protect the junk food industry,

777
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,080
the sugar industry and the junk food industry.

778
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,200
Because that was that looked like it was causing heart disease.

779
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,920
And so they were like, OK, well, we need to cover that up.

780
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,860
That was published in the German American Medical Association 2016,

781
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,140
actually internal memos from the sugar companies back in the 60s,

782
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:16,100
detailing how they paid off three Harvard professors to falsify data and publish

783
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,120
fraudulent studies to make it appear as if cholesterol caused heart disease

784
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,580
when it's much like more likely sugar to exonerate sugar and say that it was safe.

785
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:25,860
And one of those professors was named head of the USDA and use the one who offered

786
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:30,760
published in the 1977 USDA declaration saying that cholesterol causes heart disease

787
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,360
end of discussion, you know, we'll approach an argument.

788
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:40,140
And that just shut down the discussion that had been hotly debated since the 50s.

789
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:43,800
And now it was just like, no, teacher said so end of discussion.

790
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,840
And that's where we've been for the last 40 years.

791
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,840
It's fraud. It's known documented fraud.

792
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:58,100
And so, you know, there was a number of books that actually showed exactly what I'm talking about.

793
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,920
You go back to the medical textbooks.

794
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:05,120
In 1910, I have my great grandfather's medical textbook book by Sir William Osler,

795
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,140
who is the first Professor of Medicine in Johns Hopkins.

796
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,880
And he was knighted for his work in medicine,

797
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,900
who's Sir William Osler. And his medical textbook,

798
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,740
there's a chapter on diabetes. You know, the treatment,

799
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,860
the only treatment that we had for diabetes before insulin came in in the 1920s.

800
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,780
So it was back in 1910, this book was written.

801
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,740
It was a carnivore diet.

802
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,600
You put people on a meat bait, right? You get rid of carbohydrates.

803
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:34,240
And you equal parts protein and fat.

804
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:39,080
And that was the only thing that kept diabetic saliva one or two that didn't differentiate back then.

805
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,340
And they said that for the younger crowd,

806
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,220
there's a high mortality rate, but it wasn't 100%.

807
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,480
And this kept people alive eight, nine months to a year without insulin.

808
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,360
And then many of them actually survived long term.

809
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:56,680
That's in the literature that's in the medical textbooks that I have on my shelf.

810
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:57,420
Lengthen it.

811
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,120
1910.

812
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:03,080
And that was the treatment diabetes since the late 1700s.

813
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:03,800
Right?

814
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,420
And then we came up with insulin and just everything became about insulin.

815
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,560
Right?

816
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,800
And so we've forgotten our roots.

817
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:16,420
We've forgotten what people have known and paid dearly to figure out.

818
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,360
You know, in generation is before us.

819
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:21,780
So there's so many books.

820
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,060
So many books that are fantastic.

821
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:28,500
And I sort of list some of them in my website as well.

822
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:29,340
Okay, wonderful.

823
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,920
Well, I mean, when you're going to write yours, when this happens.

824
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,360
But yeah, so I have I mostly written my book.

825
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,280
I'm just sort of trying to do the finishing touches on it.

826
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:42,100
Now it's just last one pretty busy this past year.

827
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:47,500
So I haven't been able to get a chance to really sit down and crack at it.

828
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,140
But that's my my mission for the next few weeks.

829
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:54,320
Couple months is just to finish this thing up and get it out there.

830
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:54,860
Hit nice.

831
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,360
Well, best of luck.

832
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,960
Well, once it's once it's out, do let us know and maybe do a part two.

833
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,360
And yeah, yeah, we can all your work.

834
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,280
We'd love to do that.

835
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:03,260
I'll tell you.

836
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,660
I'm so excited to talk to Chokey.

837
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,160
Thank you so much for, you know, wasting your time with me.

838
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:09,620
But it was a plate.

839
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:12,440
And yeah, really appreciate it.

840
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:12,860
Not a problem.

841
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,640
Thank you for having me.
