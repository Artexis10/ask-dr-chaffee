00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:08,100
Hello, good morning. Good evening for everyone who is in America. Today is the live for April 25th in America

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,440
26th in Australia another part of the world. Thank you everyone for joining

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,880
Sorry again for being late seems to be a habit. I should probably start

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,340
Organizing these four times I can actually make but thank you all for joining and

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,940
Try to answer all the questions that are available

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,460
I do have to lead for work in about an hour and a half but I'll try to get to everything as much as I can

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,760
And thank you to elf for letting people know that I'm on my way and good to see you in the live

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,280
Chaffee: Okay, let me just get going on Instagram here as well

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,620
As you run x

10
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,620
Instagram and

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,460
YouTube as usual so great so we'll start with some of the

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,160
Superchats

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,060
First one is from cibi thank you very much cibi

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,260
Early cue because I'm in the UK. Oh, yeah, so which is in the UK so that's the middle of the night

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,380
UK won't catch this live

16
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,560
Our egg whites inflammatory is there meant to protect the yolk and

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
They say animals don't want

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,220
Chaffee: Anything eating their eggs so there must be some level defenses in them

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:30,020
There is a level of defense in the in the egg whites and some people can be more sensitive to them

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,960
Some people have more of a problem especially if you don't cook them so if you cook the egg it can be or the egg white it can be

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
Say for your denature some of these things

22
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,820
Some people don't have any problem that's me. We'll drink

23
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,260
Eggs raw I've done that myself had

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,700
No issues that I've noticed but some people do especially with auto immunity should probably avoid

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,000
Certainly raw egg whites

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,320
If not egg whites in general

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,540
Quite often they'll have

28
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,100
I won't have a problem with egg yolks, but just just be mindful of their own situation

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,120
Chaffee: You know they're giving me a lot of reasons why some people will feel better or worse on different sorts of meat or eggs

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,700
The other day doesn't really matter if they if you respond

31
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,440
differently and negatively towards them just you know something else you'd something that that makes you feel better

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,500
Chaffee: It could be a psychosumatic sort of issue that you're just not used to eating red meat or fatty meat and your body's just

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,180
Chaffee: We're to give it oh what's this and you'll get over that with with more exposure

34
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,660
But you know if you're not enjoying something or it's giving you some sort of weird reaction

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,100
You know just eat eat another meat or animal product that doesn't do that to you and

36
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,960
You know just and eat the things that you enjoy and make you feel good

37
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,270
As long as it's meat

38
00:02:51,270 --> 00:03:00,110
Chaffee: Now, thank you for the super chat. I doc. I've been told I need to temporarily stop working out when starting carnivore to let my body adjust is that true

39
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,770
And if true for how long I don't think that's necessarily true

40
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,130
I think that you just keep doing what you're doing most people feel better straight away

41
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,710
I mean, I don't know why you have to adjust to

42
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:19,030
Chaffee: Not introducing poison into your body if anything you should probably avoid working out if you're poisoning yourself because your body's being hurt

43
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:25,190
Now you're not being hurt your body's allowing you to or you're allowing your body to sort of work the way it's supposed to work

44
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,270
I guess the argument could be

45
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,230
That when you're fat adapting your body's getting you surrounding on ketones

46
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,050
I'm mobilizing fat stores and making your own carbohydrates

47
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,990
There could be a lag in your energy levels and that could you could see a bit of a dip and not feel as good

48
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,030
So maybe you give your body a rest to just

49
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,450
Get over that

50
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,010
But you don't have to you know you just be mindful that you might have a dip in your energy and your and your

51
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,110
Exercise output that usually lasts a couple weeks two three weeks at most for most people

52
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,970
There are the rare

53
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,910
Few exceptions that takes several months

54
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,450
You know some people have pretty wretched energy

55
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:12,530
Chaffee: For many months and then all of a sudden just something comes out of it and they they get out the other side and so

56
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,230
Don't necessarily know why the hell that is but it does seem to be

57
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,830
slower conversion for some people than others the vast majority of people will feel

58
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,590
Fantastic after about two weeks as far as energy levels are concerned even with their exercises

59
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,030
I know a lot of people that convert over and they don't have any dip in their exercise

60
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,730
Or their output I was one of those people and then after two weeks it just

61
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,030
Took off so

62
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,940
Chaffee: That could there will be you so I don't know I don't think you you need to avoid exercise if anything that can help

63
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,880
Stimulate and spur your body into adapting further and faster so I wouldn't I wouldn't avoid that unless it's

64
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,150
You know just making you miserable and you just need to give your body a chance to make energy properly

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,520
David Walker thank you for the super chat

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,900
75 of carnivore day 15 of the line diet

67
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,700
If my second fasted blood tests still shows triglycerides of

68
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,440
1937

69
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:25,540
Should I then continue the diet 21 year old male 180 pounds so I believe this is what this was the gentleman from

70
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,300
From the last live where we talked about

71
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,400
He said triglycerides were like a 1900 something I've never seen that in my entire life

72
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,440
I've never seen anybody with that and that's what's saying you need to get multiple data points

73
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,880
So meet does not raise triglycerides fact does not raise triglycerides dietary fat does not raise triglycerides

74
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,200
Eating carbohydrates eating sugar drinking alcohol potentially seed oils

75
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,840
Ray triglycerides so distress and so does poor sleep

76
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,540
I still never seen anybody with a 1900 on their on their triglycerides and absolutely

77
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,620
Chaffee: Never seen it go go like that because of a meat diet

78
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,900
I've seen a couple people that have gotten worse not really only one

79
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,800
That has gotten worse triglycerides when on a carnivore diet

80
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,580
But that was because they were an extraordinarily stressful situation at their work and when they

81
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,900
Came you know got out of that situation just all all came right down

82
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,920
Chaffee: So that that just normalize itself so stress is a major factor sleep is a major factor

83
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,180
Food is of course the main factor

84
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,980
Chaffee: But it's it's carbohydrates and the sugar and the alcohol that are going to raise your triglycerides and not meet

85
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:48,240
Chaffee: So yes, I would continue that I've just tried to figure out what the hell is going on with your blood tests and try to

86
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,420
Maximize your sleep

87
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,620
Chaffee: Optimize your stress levels and and make sure there's nothing else that sort of sneaking in

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,760
That might be complicating things

89
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,940
You know the 1900 I mean that sounds like it's it's not a fasted

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,840
Chaffee: Test they're saying hey right if my second fasted blood tests still shows this so that

91
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,180
Chaffee: Sort of suggest that the first one was a fasted test when you get an average test like this

92
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,900
Chaffee: It's just way off the scale you need to check it again in just basically straight away because it could just be a lab error

93
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,820
If you're if you're fasted and you're doing everything

94
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,460
In the correct way person in the morning no exercise no sex no stress or poor sleep

95
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,960
Leading up to the test

96
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,480
By a couple days

97
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,760
Then and you get some crazy number like that you check it again and you see okay, was that an accurate reading and

98
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,440
And then you try to figure out what the hell's going on there if it is an accurate reading

99
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,900
Chaffee: I would still continue the diet because the diet's not going to cause that is something else is going to cause that and you know going off

100
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,880
You you'd still be eating me right but you're adding in sugar and carbs and all these other sorts of things which will

101
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,940
Chaffee: Generally make your triglycerides worse so that's sort of adding to the problem as opposed to helping the problem

102
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,820
Chaffee: Even if you just went off and eat all together

103
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,880
Chaffee: That's not going to lower your triglycerides

104
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,280
You're going to be replacing that with carbs and sugar and seed oils which is going to

105
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,020
Raise your triglycerides so that's that's going to be the last thing you want to do

106
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,080
You're going to want to figure out why your triglycerides are crazy high like that

107
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:29,700
But again like that's that's a very average number that is very likely a lab error if you had actually if you actually done that fast. So just check it again

108
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,700
And then see how you go picture sleep picture stress make sure there's nothing else sneaking in and

109
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,240
Get more data points, you know, it could be some sort of

110
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,460
Genetic issue that I've never heard of that will slam your triglycerides up to to nearly 2,000

111
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,200
But again, I've never heard of it and

112
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,800
But it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and

113
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,660
Could be other factors that are going in and but it wouldn't it it won't be for meat meat does not raise triglycerides

114
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Fat does not animal fat does not raise triglycerides

115
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,420
So you need to find what else is doing that but first first things first check it again

116
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:14,460
Chaffee: Do it in all that the same way no stress no exercise no sex for two days leading up to it

117
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,960
Certainly not the morning of drink a lot of water

118
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,120
Fast from the net for 9 p.m. Get your test first in the morning between 8.9 a.m. Don't take any pills

119
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
Or medications and stop any multivitamins or

120
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,020
B vitamins containing biotin which is a B vitamins you just stop all

121
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,120
Vitamin supplements basically for three days before because that can change your results as well and

122
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,880
Yeah, just get more data points and then

123
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,960
Try to figure out what the hell is going on if it's an extra accurate number which is just

124
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,020
Really unlikely, but please do

125
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,220
Let us know how that goes

126
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,920
and

127
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,200
Yeah, and see how you do

128
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,290
Lena. Thank you for the super chat does the amount of dairy cause

129
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:08,730
Weight stallers it simply just the dairy itself. I only have one or two ounces a day. I even heard that can stall

130
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,370
Um

131
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,170
so

132
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,510
You know more

133
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,990
More is going to cause more of a problem more can make you gain weight

134
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:25,750
Some can make you stall the thing is choose that it's it can cause compulsive eating people just sort of

135
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,330
Go to town on cheese and dairy and

136
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,530
You know, there's you sure start removing the stop mechanism or

137
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,070
Down

138
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,810
Chaffee: Regulating the stop mechanism that your body automatically does

139
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,390
um the

140
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:49,370
When you're only eating meat if you're just eating fatty meat you can eat eat till stops facing could your body's going to regulate that and tell you hey

141
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,110
Stop now

142
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,470
If you're if you're eating other things even dairy that can

143
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:03,310
upset that and then you end up eating more than you may want and you end up eating the exact same amount of meat

144
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,090
But you're at also adding on cheese so it just make you overeat a bit one in two ounces a day

145
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,590
Not all that much so from an overeating point of view

146
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,310
Probably not an issue there are some it there are some things that can cause information

147
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:22,310
And that could potentially lead you a bit of a disruption in your

148
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,990
Your hormonal physiology and homestasis

149
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:33,230
Chaffee: You know we don't we don't have exact reasons why that could be but some people do find the dairy is a weight loss

150
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:41,350
So one of two ounces day not all that much using it as a as a condiment melting it onto meat or into eggs or something like that

151
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,230
Chaffee: That's fine for most people see how you go if you're not getting the results if you want if you're not losing weight

152
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,770
As quickly as you think you should or losing fat specifically as quickly as you should because if you're putting on muscle

153
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,470
And you're losing fat you're staying the same weight so just remember that so

154
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,050
if you

155
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,910
Don't think you're losing fat in the way that you should

156
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,810
Just drop the dairy. It's really easy so only one to two ounces so that much shouldn't be hard to give up and so

157
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:18,090
Chaffee: You just see give it up for 30 days give it to give yourself an honest chance to to see a difference and and see for yourself

158
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,010
Chaffee: But yeah, it's a classic weight loss stall

159
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,390
one to two ounces a day

160
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,710
For most people probably not that big of a deal to see how it affects you

161
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:36,020
Chaffee: Beth Ratamokker. Thank you very much for the super chat in general how long after starting carnivore with someone be fully adapted

162
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,660
Chaffee: Clearative toxins and experiencing the full benefits. Thank you

163
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,300
Well full benefits is a bit different

164
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,340
majority of benefits within a few weeks

165
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:56,640
You're gonna get a lot of these toxins out of your body a lot of them seem a lot of people seem to feel a lot better after about two weeks

166
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Chaffee: Alcohol generally takes around three to four weeks to get fully out of your system but it's almost it's better every every week every day

167
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,060
Chaffee: And so that's why I tell people you know give yourself a full 30 days because then you'll get most of the stuff out of your system

168
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,040
Chaffee: Then you'll start feeling really really good by the end of that time and you can give yourself

169
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,440
You know an accurate depiction of what you might feel like with all the stuff out of your system

170
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,280
Something's take longer so make a six is seed oils these sorts of things have a longer half life

171
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:33,000
It's like a couple of years half life so it can take years to clear this garbage out of your system and

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,940
Chaffee: After three four months you end up radically increasing amount of mitochondria

173
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,940
You're going throughout top of you this whole time you're turning over cells

174
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:49,120
Turn over cell lines you're turning over organelles and so we usually about six months on you sort of recycled and turned over all of your shows

175
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,560
You feel a lot better, but you can continue to stimulate more growth and

176
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,400
Increase the number of mitochondria and their efficacy going on to you know two three years, right?

177
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,060
So you're just going to keep getting benefits. You're going to feel

178
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,640
Chaffee: Fantastic after a few weeks you're going to get tons of things out of your system if you have any sort of medical issues

179
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,860
Chaffee: They can take

180
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,880
longer or shorter to go away a lot of them clear up quite quickly

181
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,760
Chaffee: Which is remarkable because people live with these things their whole life and they're just taking medications and medications

182
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Chaffee: They're just getting worse and worse and worse and now all of a sudden just pull

183
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,940
You know a month or two in and these these serious medical issues are

184
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:37,440
Improving dramatically or even going away others take longer so Hashimoto's can take a year or two

185
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,100
Chaffee: Before you really get your antibodies down to zero depending on how high they were

186
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,200
And and then allow your thyroid a chance to repair which and may not do all the way

187
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,840
There is such a thing as damage done if we if we permanently damage ourselves

188
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,720
Chaffee: Due to exposure to the wrong food and causing autoimmunity or just direct toxic damage

189
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,760
Chaffee: You know from eating

190
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,780
cyanide containing things like almonds and cassava and

191
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:10,240
Chaffee: Flaxseed and these sorts of things that that can permanently damage your thyroid that can permanently damage your neurological system so

192
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,980
You know that that that can leave

193
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,740
Lasting damage that's not going to heal

194
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,920
fully but you'll get as you'll heal as much as your body is able to heal

195
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,540
So you'll feel a lot better most people feel a lot better after a few weeks

196
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:34,760
Two to three weeks if you'll dramatically better and I mean, I thought like a different breed of human

197
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,040
Chaffee: Just a super hero after two weeks and most people report that as well

198
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,060
Chaffee: Some people take some longer like I said to get that energy level and all that sort of stuff

199
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,900
But if

200
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,180
If you are

201
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,540
If you're

202
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:59,660
If you're coming to like a very strict carnivore diet and you're only eating meat and only drinking water most people and getting enough fat getting enough food

203
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,020
Most people will feel a lot better after two to three weeks but you get continuing benefits

204
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,100
Chaffee: You just keep feeling better and better and better and then you start having more energy you want to start working out

205
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,900
Chaffee: And that's going to obviously improve your health even more

206
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,720
So you get a vast amount of benefit within a few weeks and

207
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,820
Then you keep getting more benefits after that that makes sense so full maximum benefits

208
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,780
That's a lifelong expression right

209
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,360
But you keep getting it you get a lot of benefit just right away getting this garbage out of your system and

210
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,450
That can make you feel dramatically better within a couple weeks

211
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,060
Another question from Lena. Thank you very much Lena

212
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,400
Carnivore for about four months still no weight loss how much longer do you think till it comes off still facing brain fog

213
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,160
Am I not fat adapted yet?

214
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,380
Chaffee: So this was this was a question about

215
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,720
Chaffee: Dairy so look you're in that situation where you're not necessarily

216
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,060
Chaffee: Losing much weight remember that if you put on muscle and you lose fat you will stay the same weight

217
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,440
So the scale is really not what's important a lot it's really important for people to really focus on their health

218
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,620
As opposed to the scale the vast majority of people will lose weight and fat

219
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,080
Chaffee: Early on but other people will be you know everyone comes from a different situation metabolically and

220
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,340
hormonally and so you just need to look at things from where you are and focus on your health

221
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,340
This is about being healthy first and foremost. This is not a weight loss and gimmick

222
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,780
This is a health

223
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,220
Chaffee: Optimization technique this is this is eating to our biological design and being as health

224
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:44,140
Chaffee: We can possibly be that's the main thing weight generally comes along with that that loss generally comes along with that

225
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,680
But it's that it's important to focus on the health aspects

226
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:57,440
So think about how this is helping you think about how this is benefiting you and and and go from there and let the other things come as well

227
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,840
brain fog

228
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,400
Is rare but again there's there are some people that

229
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,080
It takes months before they really start seeing the full benefits

230
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,280
I don't exactly know why I haven't

231
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,220
Figured that one out yet

232
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,440
Chaffee: Because it's very rare. We just don't see it every now and then and then just all of a sudden just something just ticked over and just people feel

233
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,340
Massively better and their weight starts coming up. There are a lot of reasons for for weight loss

234
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,500
Stalls could be dairy could be other things that you're including in your diet like artificial sweeteners

235
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,080
That's a common one people including a rethought all monk fruit sugar

236
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,840
Chaffee: Stevia these sorts of things because they think well, it's natural sweet normal sugars and natural sweeteners, right?

237
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,300
And so you're we're avoiding that too. So, you know, you just want it just just eat fatty meat

238
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,780
Until it stops tasting good just cut out everything else just keep it simple

239
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,880
Chaffee: Have you know a bit of organs things like that the higher nutrient density

240
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,580
Chaffee: More saturated you're going to be earlier on your body's chasing nutrients. It's not chasing calories

241
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,680
So you don't want to eat the ton of of organs because that can be overwhelming to your system. You can get too much of a good thing

242
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,680
and

243
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,420
Have a hypervotaminosis or

244
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:13,240
Chaffee: Increased especially the fat soluble vitamins like vitamin A or things like copper and then different metals. They build up

245
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,760
And take a longer to clear out of your system than say like water soluble vitamins like b vitamins, right?

246
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,160
So just be mindful of that

247
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,020
But having a bit of organs especially early on when you're transitioning it's great idea

248
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,260
You know, it's nature's multivitamin, right? And so

249
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:38,140
And so you can try that there are other reasons different hormonal reasons things that people have leptin resistance LEPTIN

250
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,900
Chaffee: That's elevated. It's generally very difficult to lose weight from most people and

251
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:51,740
Chaffee: Some people still can but a lot of people don't a lot of people when they have high leptin. It's very stubborn weight loss

252
00:19:51,740 --> 00:20:00,100
And that can be an indicative of a slowed and damaged metabolism and so you need to coaxial metabolism to increase

253
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:07,580
You don't want to starve it and suppress your metabolism more and that's what happens if you can if you chronically limit the amount of nutrients and

254
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,680
Energy available through your diet

255
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,440
Chaffee: Your body's just going to shut things down and you're going to feel really tired. You're going to have horrible brain fog

256
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,380
Chaffee: You're going to feel wretched and you're not going to really lose weight because your body's saying no, no, we have to store everything

257
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:28,050
Chaffee: Coming in is going into fat because we need to survive a famine and so just hold energy levels are down because less coming in less is going out

258
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,120
As you want to do the opposite you want to coax your system you want to coax your metabolism and speed it up

259
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,660
So you want to do things like exercise and aerobic exercise

260
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,560
So resistance training

261
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,600
Sprinting those sorts of things even though you feel tired you do it you'll get something done you

262
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,020
Start encouraging your system to work but you need to eat enough as well

263
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,060
You don't just want to exercise and not eat enough because then you're doing the opposite as well

264
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:58,340
Chaffee: Your body's like well now we really need to save everything because you know we're having a high demand output and

265
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,180
You know we're not getting enough in so we really need to hang on to this tightly

266
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,980
So they'll do that

267
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:12,580
Eat enough and eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good and you'll try that twice a day if you need to especially if you're working out

268
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,700
And see how that goes you can check test your blood you can test your thyroid you can test your

269
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,540
Leptin you can test your fasting insulin these are signs these are different things that if they're out of balance that can

270
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,360
Cause slow weight loss and and slow metabolism

271
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:36,480
Chaffee: You can also check your your nutrient status your B12 your vitamin D your zinc and your magnesium these are very important things

272
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,200
You get them with meat but

273
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,040
Chaffee: People when you're starting on this thing most people are a very deficient diet and not taking supplements

274
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,800
And so they're gonna be quite deficient in these things too to extend that the reference ranges have actually slid down and gotten

275
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,980
Chaffee: Lower because they're just an average for the community since everybody's deficient in magnesium

276
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,380
Chaffee: B12 zinc and vitamin D

277
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,700
Chaffee: They're just like just move that reference range. Yeah, well, this is normal now

278
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,030
Chaffee: It's like that's the new norm deficiencies the new normal apparently and

279
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,270
No, it's not normal and so if you're in the reference range for these sorts of things

280
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,510
Chaffee: You're not on the really upper end of that reference range or above that reference range you're low

281
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,470
That's all there is to it. I'm never seen

282
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,210
Any country or any any lab that

283
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:33,690
Had a reference range for B12 that's actually made it into what I would consider an optimal reference range for B12

284
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,730
So the other ones

285
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,870
You know sometimes they sort of lip into the right range but not always

286
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:46,710
So you want to be on the upper end of their reference range if you're sort of low normal for them you're really low

287
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,330
If you're low low for them

288
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,250
Really low

289
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,870
So you can check those things as well

290
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,350
But just be patient get out everything except fatty meat and water

291
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:03,250
Chaffee: And make sure you're eating enough make sure you're sleeping well because that can be a major stall as well if you're stressed out

292
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,730
You're not sleeping well that raises cortisol and that will stall your way loss and

293
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,470
There are a lot of different things it food is

294
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:21,130
The main factor here, but these other factors really matter as well so just keep that in mind as well and and then just just keep giving it time

295
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:27,170
Chaffee: You know it can take longer for some people than others even when they're doing it right the vast majority of people

296
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,530
Don't have as much of a delay as this

297
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:39,470
But you know it will happen for you too. I've never seen anyone not get there and some people

298
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,150
Chaffee: I see that their leptins massively elevated and it just takes time and they're not really losing weight

299
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,590
Chaffee: Not really losing weight not really losing weight and then all of a sudden their leptins coming down the whole time

300
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:56,410
And then also just hits that tipping point and the rest of their metabolism other sorts of factors coming to play and just well then they start losing weight

301
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,550
I just had a lady actually

302
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,130
I've been following since last year

303
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:04,950
She

304
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:12,950
Has been doing this and you explain that to her and and she'd been over way to whole life nothing had ever worked and

305
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,750
And she came around around this and she said okay, I'm just gonna give it a try

306
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,790
Chaffee: You know, I knew it can take longer and and she's doing this for her health and she just really enjoyed it

307
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:27,270
Chaffee: She was eating well and things would and you know, it wasn't hard for her to do so just like okay, you know

308
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:33,990
Chaffee: She wasn't really losing much weight but her leptin was sky high and her fasting insulin was very elevated as well

309
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,910
Chaffee: She had other other markers that you know, this was gonna take a while and

310
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:44,090
You know, so we we corrected things and added a bit of liver and all these sorts of things

311
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,410
She was able to eat and we just sort of tractor every month and she's usually losing a bit

312
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,630
But not all that much and

313
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,310
You know really just very slow, but she's like, yeah, I'm just I'm in this for the long haul

314
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,310
You know, I feel good

315
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,770
I'm just gonna focus on my health and just give it time

316
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:05,990
That was back in August, right? So it was a long time ago, right and just last month

317
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:12,330
She came in hadn't seen it for sort of a month before that and every month

318
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,450
She was just sort of like losing just a little bit a little bit a little bit and then all of a sudden bam

319
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,690
16 kilos

320
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,510
Which is

321
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,590
Significant right I mean, that's like 35 pounds right so

322
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:32,130
Chaffee: That was in a month month six weeks, you know, and so that just that just happened to hit just that was it or

323
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,040
Chaffee: Or left him was coming down down down and then bang

324
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,950
Just dropping all this weight so

325
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,470
Chaffee: You know that that is generally what happened as you're body needs to just get to a point where it's happy and it's saying

326
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,180
Chaffee: Okay, we're not in a family anymore. We can release this so

327
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,790
Fix all those other things and

328
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,760
Then after that just give it time and I think it'll do fine

329
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,830
I'm sure you'll do fine

330
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,670
Akin thank you for the super chat

331
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,410
question

332
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,090
Chaffee: I've just got my first A1c after starting carnivore serum sugar

333
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,850
From eight to seven point two A1c from six point eight to six point four

334
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,850
Triangle stretch one point one HCl one

335
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:21,730
I'm disappointed my HBA one C isn't lower what might be the next step I need to take well first of all it came down and that's good

336
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,790
Doesn't doesn't do that any other way, right? I mean what what

337
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,370
You know have you what have you done so far that has given you

338
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,150
Even that much of the drop in your A1c

339
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,670
Right so you know, I mean this is we need to be

340
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:41,510
Appreciative of this as well you know count your blessings some people have have more of a drop than that but

341
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,050
You know who cares you know like some of some people have you know when you're coming from the very higher

342
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,370
Levels of A1c that can have a more dramatic drop

343
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,550
So I mean I've seen people with a HBA one C of you know 13 14

344
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,790
Drop down to you know five or six after three four months. That's that's incredible, right?

345
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,910
So that doesn't happen but that doesn't happen either

346
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:14,430
Sounds what was it go from six point eight to six point four only just goes up and just goes up it goes up and you try to slow it down with the medication and life style

347
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,750
But it only goes up that that was the previous thought and teaching was it?

348
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,190
This is a progressive disease and it only gets worse, right?

349
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:29,810
Not anymore so you're already improving and that's that's you're already

350
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:37,790
Breaking the norm breaking the standard so that's great. You should be really happy with that also how long was it between tests

351
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,790
Right, you know was it one month two months three months five months six months a year

352
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:48,250
Right, obviously that's kind of matter two so the point the the main thing is is the trend

353
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,630
You're trending in the right direction also if you're on

354
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,590
Blood sugar medications for your diabetes you should not stop them until

355
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:03,390
Your blood sugar indicates that it's appropriate to if you're if you're you're fasting blood sugar

356
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:09,330
You really should be between four and five that's what you want to keep it and so if you need medications to keep it there

357
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,050
Take medication is to keep it there, right

358
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,510
Going from eight to seven point two and dropping from six point eight to six point four that

359
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,270
That seems about right, you know you want to be you want your fasting steer

360
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:27,610
Fasting blood sugar to be between four and five really so you still have insulin resistance

361
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,230
You still have diabetes. You still need to take medication if you're on it

362
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,970
Chaffee: You should probably be on it

363
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:40,990
Chaffee: In this case that can help you bring that blood sugar down and reduce the insulin resistance or give you an up insulin if you're not producing it

364
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,950
For now, but it's

365
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,130
Most people can come off insulin

366
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,450
But it takes time

367
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,910
Right, so it can take you know people

368
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:57,510
Chaffee: You know people get you're very excited that that this can help reverse their diabetes

369
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,410
Chaffee: So they go, okay, if I just stop eating carbs, I don't have diabetes anymore

370
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,890
No, not yet, you know you have you have lead poisoning, right? And so you stop drinking

371
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,910
Chaffee: Let it water great. There's still lead in your body. There's still poison in your body

372
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:18,030
Chaffee: Your body still has to recover from that and if you need medications to get that lead for their out of your system and heal and repair the damage from that lead

373
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,530
Chaffee: Great, you know, then so be it. Thank goodness. They have medications for those things

374
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,590
I don't think we use that as a crutch to justify eating a whole bunch of carbs and sugar

375
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,110
Definitely not but if you need it

376
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,870
Because you have damage and you're you're using it as a bridge when you're transitioning to a

377
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:44,050
Great, that's very useful and so that's what medication is supposed to be for it's this temporary bridge to get you to where you need to go

378
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,430
not just a lifelong

379
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:52,770
You know, lifelong condition that you have to chronically be taking even though that's what they are

380
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,850
Build for and design for because

381
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,650
That's what makes them the most money is if you take this to rest of your life

382
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:02,750
You don't need to take it to rest of your life, but you may need to take it right now

383
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,230
Chaffee: So if you if you're on medication, I continue taking your medication

384
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:12,250
Chaffee: I would try to get your blood sugar down between four and five when you're especially when you're fasting

385
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,550
And and if you need you know that form in or whatever you're taking to achieve that

386
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:24,190
So be it. Don't come off your medication until it's actually appropriate to what you know what

387
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:30,770
Whatever you're doing is working. So that's good. You know, it's all about the trend. You're going in the right direction and so

388
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:38,470
Why would we be upset about that it's going in the right direction? You know, we can all want in instant results

389
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:45,970
But this is amazing that doesn't happen normally right and so doing anything else that doesn't happen

390
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,990
This is the only thing that has ever done that right there

391
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:57,530
Right and so you'd be very happy about that be very proud of that and just look forward to the rest look forward to

392
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:07,330
Continuing get better, you know, if you know, if you're if you're not pure pure pure fatty meat and water get there

393
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,610
Chaffee: And and get rid of all artificial sweeteners everything I don't care if they don't have carbs and then

394
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,490
I don't care if Aliulos has a much lower glycemic index just don't eat it

395
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,170
Just don't have it just eat fatty meat

396
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:30,170
Chaffee: Only drink water you'd do your full stay on meds when you need them come off when it's appropriate and you will do you will do just fine

397
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,030
Chaffee: And you will reverse your diabetes as what people all around the world are doing

398
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,510
Of by the millions now. It's absolutely incredible. So

399
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,710
You know, just keep it up keep going get as pure as you can and

400
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:48,190
Chaffee: Just be patient. It is going in the right direction and you're doing great. So just keep it up

401
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,440
Chaffee: Beth Rathamocker. Thank you for the super chat. I heard that ground beef is higher in histamines than other meat

402
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,000
How do you know if you're sensitive to histamines? Sorry

403
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,120
Some requests is now. That's perfectly fine. So you know the thing is is that

404
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
Whether or not there are histamines in there

405
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,420
Doesn't matter if you react to it that that's that's the thing so some people

406
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:21,140
Get some sort of a reaction that they that is unpleasant to them when they have brown beef or when they have

407
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,280
Leftovers they put in the refrigerator to have it the next day and give them some sort of weird reaction

408
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:32,420
Chaffee: Is that histamines? Is that something else who knows? I mean I talked to people all the time

409
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,600
They swear by it being his means. I talked to other people. They're like there's no chance in hell

410
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,740
That that's the case. It's I think it's something else

411
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,360
Doesn't matter what matters is that you're reacting to it right and so that's the only thing that matters

412
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,280
so it's not a matter of of

413
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,440
Knowing if your sensitive to histamines are not

414
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,720
If that's even a thing, would you maybe? I don't know. I don't really care

415
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,100
I'm looking at this more from a practical standpoint

416
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,900
Do you eat ground beef is that?

417
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,500
Giving you a reaction that's negative?

418
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,300
Chaffee: Yes, eat something else. No go to town. That's the only thing that matters

419
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,140
Chaffee: So it doesn't matter why you're getting a reaction or you're not getting a reaction

420
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,660
If it's just can you eat it? Do you enjoy it? Is it making you feel good? Yes? Keep eating it? No

421
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,300
Find something else. It doesn't give you the same reaction and so that's the main thing so just try it out

422
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,460
Try some ground beef if you don't have any problems with ground meats and no problem

423
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,700
Beth Rathamocker. Thank you for the super chat

424
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:35,840
Chaffee: Hunger changes from day to day. So it seems like I eat it different times every day. Is it okay?

425
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:42,940
Chaffee: Not to have any kind of schedule. Thank you is always that's fine. Just eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good

426
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,160
If you're doing that in the morning or during the day, you're gonna get a bit more tired especially if you're eating

427
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,000
Maximally and so you're just may

428
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,680
Bung up your day

429
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,700
So if you're doing that during the day, maybe try to eat less than your body wants just sort of half as much take the edge off

430
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,360
So you can keep going and still have good energy levels. I

431
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:07,640
And to eat my bigger meals later in the day later at night because that

432
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:14,680
Automatically just makes me a bit more tired and I want to go to sleep and that's a good time to go to sleep is at night

433
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:15,640
So

434
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:22,360
But yeah, just the fatty meat until it stops tasting good and and do so in a way that's logistically feasible for you

435
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,220
So you're not getting tired or work on things like that

436
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,360
Carnavoir says not a question just want to thank you

437
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,900
For doing a stocked shape you we need more people like you. Well, thank you very much Tom. I appreciate that

438
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,440
Reabell. Thank you for the super chat

439
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,000
Is there any type? Is there any hope for someone on the carnivore diet

440
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,960
Chaffee: Who had to stop carnivore due to alpha gals syndrome? Carma hydrates mess me up so bad as well

441
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,980
And I don't know what to eat anymore. Yeah, no, you absolutely can it's just you have to avoid red meat

442
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,760
So the other meats are fine. So like chicken and fish

443
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,600
Possibly pork don't look that up though um and

444
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,120
And and take a look, but yeah, so

445
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,820
Yes, you can it's it's really just like the red meats that you that you need to avoid

446
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,080
And from what I have

447
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,200
What I have been told by other doctors is that it is it's basically temporary and so after

448
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,160
You know after a couple months or you know six months or a year or something like that

449
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,520
Chaffee: You lose that sensitivity and you can start eating red meat again. So yes, there's definitely hope

450
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:43,600
Not even hope you can just keep doing this right now you just need to avoid the red meats and so it

451
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:50,820
On deck chicken fish eggs and things like that. I mean you can you can find online which meets will have the alpha clock toast

452
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,920
What about how it is that you you react to

453
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,060
from that tick bite

454
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,860
It is thankfully still pretty rare

455
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,100
Who knows how much more prevalent that's gonna get pretty

456
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,700
Is this you know coincidental this is this is happening?

457
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,400
Chaffee: We'll be able to try to get us to the less red meat and all of a sudden people developing allergies towards a red meat

458
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,360
Chaffee: When that's what people were saying. Well, this is what we should do just to make people allergic to red meat

459
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,940
So that they they don't eat as much so we force them to not eat as much

460
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:28,060
I think that's that's kind of funny that this is coming out exactly exactly the same time that you said that that's

461
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,860
a way that we should

462
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,440
Way we can control people to eat less red meat

463
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,120
Not saying that that's what it is, but it's a bit odd that they're saying that I don't know how hell they would do that

464
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,600
They're does seem to be a tick bite, you know the low-star tick that's that's causing this or at least that's what's being reported

465
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,760
and we all

466
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,880
You know have our opinions on how accurate and

467
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,920
authentic and honest the reporting is these days either way

468
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,460
Seems that red meat's a problem there and so you just eat chicken fish eggs things like that and

469
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,660
You'll look up the different sorts of things that that are safe to eat on alpha gal and

470
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,580
and you know then six months or so

471
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,420
You know try some beef again see how you go with it and hopefully

472
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:22,320
That goes away, but yeah, you can absolutely still just eat meat now. You don't have to eat carbs or any of the other garbage

473
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,060
So yeah, you can still definitely just eat carnivore

474
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,690
Joe comic thank you for the super chat

475
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:36,170
ever seen carnivore for prostitutes 58 years old

476
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:43,950
dealing with prostitutes after stream injections or steam injections for

477
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:53,590
20 months ago PSA 2.5 paying information pelvic tightness sex issues all post procedure. I'm really sorry to hear that

478
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:01,190
Chaffee: You know it really just depends on what's what's causing these things if you have a of a sort of post-operative

479
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,070
complication

480
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:13,110
It's at least going to give you a body a chance to heal as much as that as it can it can help with BPH and you know just reducing insulin can help reduce BPH

481
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,630
so

482
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:21,110
You know the actual damage and pain and dysfunction from that procedure

483
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:30,630
I don't know I just have to sort of see but you know being on on an optimal diet like a carnivore diet or

484
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:38,430
The carnivore diet of the carnivore diet is at least going to put your body into a position that it can heal as well as possible

485
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:45,930
and and be as healthy as it's possible to be and recover and heal from as much as you're able to heal from

486
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,790
I don't think that you're going to be able

487
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,130
to heal as well if you're on anything else anyway

488
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,530
So it's definitely worth a shot hopefully it does help you

489
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:02,190
But um, there's really no way to tell you know, I mean there's things there there is again such thing such a thing is damaged

490
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:06,210
Chaffee: Done and if you have permanent damage due to injury from a procedure

491
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:12,570
It may not recover but a lot of things do recover and this will at least give you the best chance to

492
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,970
To recover that you can you can get and good luck with that. I hope it works

493
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,500
George story. Thank you for the super chat

494
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,620
How did the micro nutrients and bacon and eggs compare to room minute meat?

495
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:39,500
Our bacon and eggs sustainable long-term as a primary food store so on carnivore. Yeah, you know, I mean it's it's probably better with the red meat the room minute meat

496
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,820
They're also going to be able to filter out more of the plant toxins especially when they're being fed

497
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:50,340
Things that they're not designed to eat pigs and chicken being fed corn and so are they're not designed to eat that stuff

498
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:54,020
They're not going to be able to detoxify as much. They're not going to get as much nutrients from it

499
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,200
They're not going to be as nutritious. They're not going to have

500
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,640
Be able to filter out more of those new those toxins

501
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,440
Whereas a you know a room minute animal like a cow they ferment this stuff and break it down make it much more nutrient rich

502
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,040
Even if it's not their natural diet and

503
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,640
Detoxify more of these things through that fermentation process and so it's safer

504
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,100
Chaffee: But we're toxic load higher nutritional about nutrient density, but

505
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,060
There's a difference again between

506
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,820
Grass fed and finish regeneratively raised beef and

507
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,560
Feet lot beef, right?

508
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,860
Chaffee: There's only you know a couple months in the feed lot of three months in the feed lot and that can significantly reduce the amount of nutrients that are in there

509
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,180
Chaffee: And doing it on a regenerative pattern where you're moving the animals around and you regenerating the land

510
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,460
Chaffee: You're actually regenerating the nutrients you building up more nutrients. It's pretty crazy to think about you think of it

511
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:56,980
Chaffee: You just keep it sort of stable, but no actually increases the nutrients in the soil in the grass in the cow

512
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,960
And then more nutrients going around just more more more more more more so doing in that process makes that makes the cow more

513
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,360
Nutritious makes the land more more more viable and fertile

514
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,800
It's pretty amazing. It's absolutely amazing amazing

515
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,380
The ecology of it all

516
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,120
so

517
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,660
Bacon and eggs

518
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,660
You know, are you getting pasture raised pork or are you getting pasture raised chicken and eggs?

519
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,040
That's going to make a big difference too

520
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,260
Chaffee: Massive difference. You have a massive difference in the amount of micronutrients available as well

521
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,500
Yes, you could eat bacon and eggs rest of your life. If they're pasture raised bacon and eggs, it's going to be a lot better a lot better

522
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,680
Chaffee: And

523
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,000
Chaffee: Some people just can't do that some people thought I'm going to use your other issues

524
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,960
Can't really do

525
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,580
Or eggs or even chicken or farm deficient particular so but you know if you do good do well on

526
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,160
Chaffee: Bacon and eggs and you feel fine just make sure you get bacon. It doesn't have much of sugar in it

527
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,200
Try to get like no sugar cure bacon and

528
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:03,040
You know and you should be fine if you feel good you feel good. I feel best on beef

529
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,300
Hands down. I feel great on bacon and eggs

530
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:15,200
Certainly taste good, but I always feel the best on beef red meat in particular red meat in general anyway

531
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,000
So just see how you go, but yeah, you could you could eat bacon and eggs rest of your life

532
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,880
Tebo, thank you for the for the question. I'd like to ask Dr. Chafe to address my sick feeling after

533
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,520
Just eating meat ten days in a carnivore, please

534
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,980
Yeah, often this is this is that psychosomatic sort of

535
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:39,320
Condition response where we're like, well meet bad for me. That's bad for me. I'm gonna avoid this

536
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,000
That's your your brain is telling you. Oh, this is bad. This is bad

537
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,280
You need avoid that but also

538
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,640
You if you're getting a negative feeling you're short of feeling sick and it doesn't really taste good

539
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,360
Chaffee: You brought it your body is telling you no uncertain terms that you are not hungry anymore

540
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,860
So you eat fatty meat until it stops tasting good

541
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,820
Chaffee: If you if it's if it's the fat is making you a bit queasy and nauseous you need to ease and do it

542
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,320
Chaffee: Just have smaller amounts of fat cut off a piece of fat put it with only a piece of meat

543
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,940
Chaffee: Eat it together say like, oh, okay, that actually tastes nice together and you go on from there

544
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,000
Any sort of build up it can take months before you undo that conditioning that we've all had

545
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,340
Chaffee: For entire lives about how horrible that is for you. So we actually get a visceral

546
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,520
Response that we're feel sick

547
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:32,060
So you can ease into it that way but also if you're eating fatty meat and it tastes good eventually

548
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,660
It's gonna not taste good and that's your body telling you to stop and if you keep going

549
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,060
He's oh, well, I have to finish my plate. I haven't eaten that much and but oh, I feel sick

550
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,980
I'm feeling all that your body telling you to stop it doesn't matter how much is on your plate

551
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,700
Stop just putting in the fridge right your body knows what it's doing as long as you're just eating

552
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,900
fatty meat and water

553
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,000
Chaffee: Let your body handle it so if you're if you're not feeling well feeling sick or queasy and you don't really want to eat meat don't eat

554
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,000
Right

555
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,040
Chaffee: But if your body selling you not to eat meat. It's telling you just not to eat. It's not just telling you not to eat meat. It's telling you

556
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,220
Not to eat okay, so that would be that would be my advice

557
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:20,640
Question from Charles Ben Dari. Hi. I have been following you from Ghana very cool. Can you explain further to me?

558
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,640
That we don't really

559
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,660
We don't really like vegetables is it because of the chemicals applied to them or

560
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,660
Naturally not good for humans. Yeah, they're just naturally not good for humans think about it this way

561
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,220
You get lost in the in the woods or the jungles of Ghana and you run out of food

562
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:42,550
Chaffee: You know, can you eat any random plant in the forest? No, most of them will make you very very sick or even kill you

563
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,920
The vast majority of plants will kill

564
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,520
You and every other animal on earth, right

565
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:57,900
So all plants are poisonous. It's just that certain animals evolve the ability to eat certain plants and detoxify them safely

566
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,400
And they can eat that plant

567
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Chaffee: But if they go outside of that they get very sick and this is why animals in the wild they eat very specific plants

568
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,920
Then they venture outside of that they can get very very sick or they can even die

569
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,820
So the plant itself is bad for us and then we add insult to injury and we dump a bunch of

570
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,920
Chemical toxins and pesticides on them

571
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,640
Make them even more poisonous. So

572
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,400
Chaffee: There's definitely a combination there. You know the pesticides are definitely not good for you

573
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,840
The plants worse so I would I would avoid that if you if you watch on

574
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,620
Chaffee: YouTube there's a there's a lecture I gave it a medical conference that I just

575
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:46,900
Chaffee: You know, just went from big air and just named it plants are trying to kill you and I made this argument in front of

576
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,080
Chaffee: Not be recommending these things to your patients and

577
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:58,740
Very skeptical crowd at first by the end of it. You know, I it was very well received and I had a lot of people coming out to me after that

578
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,580
You know, you know, just like you know white hair professors of medicine, you know very

579
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:09,660
All steer and suits coming out to me saying like I never want to eat a goddamn vegetable again in my life

580
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,540
I'm sorry

581
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,440
You know job done so

582
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,840
It's you know what's that it's on the low carb down under YouTube channel and

583
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,760
I have I have one called by the same name

584
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,480
Chaffee: Plant your trying to kill you on my channel is more of a discussion we talk about very similar points

585
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,680
But I like the one on low carb down under because it's just

586
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,400
You know it's a it's a presentation, you know, it's not a discussion. I'm just you know

587
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,200
hitting points and and there's you know these visuals because I have a PowerPoint as

588
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,440
presentation as well so it's

589
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,200
That's the one to watch and that tells you exactly

590
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,240
you know why

591
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:53,960
Chaffee: It's a plant themselves that we have to worry about more than the pesticides and and actually we looked at the comparison of this and found that

592
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,300
The natural plant toxins are actually worse than the pesticides at least the ones that they've studied

593
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,520
Back in the the late 80s really 90s. So yeah, check that out

594
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,720
But yeah, it's the plant itself and the and the chemical to reply to that just make it worse

595
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,550
These thank you very much for the generous super chat

596
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:16,930
The Valkorn of War for seven months plus

597
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:22,470
Chaffee: Dealing with Tartar buildup which I understand is more calcium and saliva

598
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:31,110
Chaffee: I don't hear a lot of people mention this is this normal. Yeah, can be you know if you look back at the fossil record you know a pre-agrarian

599
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:38,350
People that big wide jaws perfect teeth all 32 of rupted and perfect and

600
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:42,910
And there's buildup there's there's um

601
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,550
You know there's

602
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:51,150
Calcifications or or whatever the hell of some sort of sort of harder buildup in between the teeth so you know there goes

603
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:59,210
Flossing you don't need to floss and probably protects those the teeth and the gums and things like that as this little little layer

604
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:04,990
So they had that excellent teeth excellent teeth health and you see that sort of patina

605
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:11,350
of buildup in there and actually you know survived in the fossil record so

606
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,690
You know when when you have the normal

607
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:21,130
Oral biome that's probably very normal, you know, we like having clean teeth with all that stuff scraped off so we do

608
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,050
fine

609
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,050
But it seemed in the in the wild and nature

610
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:30,890
I was a very normal thing to have that buildup in between the teeth and protecting the gums and things like that

611
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:36,150
Chaffee: So if you're eating car or maybe other sorts of things you're going to get the wrong kind of bacteria

612
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:41,210
Chaffee: You're going to get a different oral biome and you are going to have

613
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,090
Rodding and nasty sort of things you get that buildup

614
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,230
You're going to have a whole bunch of

615
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:52,270
Bad bacteria in there and that's going to cause other problems the other thing too is that people find that

616
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,730
Chaffee: Oxilates can do that as well so you have sort of oxidative by sort of getting rid of oxilates can get more

617
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:03,490
Tarder buildup in your mouth and you can you can get pretty dramatic and so you might have to get more cleanings or

618
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:08,670
You know scrape that off more regularly and that can be from

619
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:14,610
From the oxilates as well and some people don't have much of an issue as well so it can be normal

620
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:21,470
You know long before we had dentists, you know, we had teeth and they didn't run out of our heads and animals

621
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,290
No, I don't have dentists and their teeth don't run out of their head

622
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:29,970
Chaffee: So and what we we noticed what in the fossil record was that you did get that sort of buildup so that can be normal

623
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,050
But also it can be

624
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,250
Buildup of you know from from dumping out oxilates and

625
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:42,470
Building up sort of calcium oxilate deposits around your teeth as well because you might just try to get this stuff to hell out because it's just poison

626
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:49,150
And you know, but if you if you you don't want to get that stuff scraped off get it scraped off, you know, that's fine and

627
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,930
If it's oxilates that will slow down eventually and and just

628
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:58,950
Chaffee: Get just a bit more normal, but you shouldn't get cavities anyway as long as you're not eating

629
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:01,030
Anything else besides me

630
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,840
Carnivorous plant. Thank you for the super chat

631
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,700
Chaffee: Does carnivore help with her pseudism? Her pseudism is inappropriate hair growth

632
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:15,400
On women so body and facial hair that would be in more typically male pattern

633
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:20,320
Due to high testosterone typically so it depends on what's causing it

634
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:26,400
But the leading cause of PCOS which is elevated testosterone and women and

635
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,500
Lowered estrogen levels

636
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:33,680
Leading to infertility and and polycystical variance syndrome is PCOS

637
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:34,900
That

638
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,920
The leading cause of that and that's the leading cause of infertility and women is

639
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,560
Chaffee: Insulin resistance so high insulin having high insulin

640
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:47,960
Chaffee: Chronically high insulin because women make estrogen or testosterone first and that conversion to estrogen in the ovaries

641
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,120
And so elevated

642
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:54,320
Insulin will block the conversion testosterone into estrogen so you get too much testosterone

643
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,880
And you get her pseudism because you get you're getting too much too much testosterone

644
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,500
So it can help with that

645
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,060
Chaffee: Are there other cause of her pseudism or there other causes of having excess testosterone? Yes, absolutely

646
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,380
But it can certainly help with the some of the more common causes

647
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,280
Which is what I just described there that the insulin resistance

648
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,140
Any ketogenic time should do that especially when you're getting rid of lectins

649
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,380
Different plant toxins that can actually bind on to the insulin receptors

650
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:30,680
By the times more tightly than insulin shouldn't get even though you're not even carbohydrates

651
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,040
And your insulin is normal you still get an insulin like a fact and insulin affects

652
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:41,040
Over a hundred different processes in your body including the conversion of testosterone and estrogen and so

653
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,000
Even just the lectins can do that as well and so yes, it can definitely help that

654
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,220
But again it depends on what's causing the her pseudism

655
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,180
I mean medications that can do that to

656
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,880
Gunther SB thank you for the super chat

657
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,200
If oh also

658
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,860
Which probably stop super chats now because I got a

659
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,380
lot load of them and

660
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,780
So

661
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,520
I need to leave I had around 11 because I have I have

662
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:12,920
appointment

663
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,560
Shortly after that

664
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,420
Chaffee: So if rabbis have a wonderful on a faculty protein ratio

665
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,620
Chaffee: What are some good non-rendered sources of roommate fat?

666
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,940
I can add to boost to a two to one

667
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:32,620
Fat protein ratio non-rendered the not only non-render would be just getting

668
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,800
cuts of

669
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,280
Fat the fat trimmings from the butcher and just frying those up in a pan and even those together

670
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,520
Just have a little

671
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,860
Palo fat next year your meat as well

672
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,820
You know if you wanted the other floor would be like melted butter

673
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,900
Palo those sorts of things but really just the the fat trimmings

674
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,140
That's the best way to do that especially in a non-rendered form

675
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,870
K&N can thank you for the super chat

676
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:05,010
Chaffee: Hi doc. I have a family member with type two diabetes and stage three colon cancer

677
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:09,250
Chaffee: They are on a lot of meds. I tell them to try keto or corn or more please help

678
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:15,350
Well look I mean, you know that's that's very good of you to to recommend that. I think it will help both

679
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:24,630
We know we that that died two diabetes is reversible clinically by putting people on a high fat meat-based ketogenic diet

680
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,190
Like a corn or more diet so we know that

681
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:34,150
So that'll help but also that high blood sugar from the diabetes is feeding the colon cancer

682
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:39,150
So ask them if they ever got a pet scan and you get that pet scan you see where these hotspots are

683
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,150
So that's a cancer

684
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,770
Light up like a Christmas tree. Why does it light up because we give them an injection of glucose

685
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,950
That's radio labeled and then we see where that glucose goes where that sugar goes

686
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:55,350
Right where those carbs go and it goes right to that cancer in a pool and I can't you just sucks at all

687
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:56,510
up right

688
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,090
Every time they have carbs

689
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:03,210
They need to remember that pet scan that their cancer is now lighting up

690
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:07,090
And all those cancer cells are whole flush with energy

691
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:10,010
That's what happens every time you eat carbs and you have cancer

692
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:11,790
so

693
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:20,110
Chaffee: Colon cancer is not caused by red meat that's an insanity that's just it's liable really and slander and

694
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:26,930
I wish red meat could sue the people and doctors that that push out that slider because it's a complete bullshit

695
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:34,130
There are a lot of people treating colon cancer by going on a pure red meat and water diet only and it's

696
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,070
pushing back their disease

697
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,890
Look up ketogenic metabolic therapy

698
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:46,110
Chaffee: Work with professor Thomas C3 look up Thomas C3 S. E. Y. F. R. I. E. D

699
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:55,410
Check out my interview with him on this channel and and you'll see what I mean. This is this is

700
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,870
You know this this is you know if you understand the biology of cancer

701
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:03,970
It's it's very straightforward and you would treat this very differently than we're treating it now

702
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:10,650
Chaffee: I also gave a lecture at another medical conference called ketogenic metabolic therapy as an adjunct to

703
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,010
as a novel adjunct to

704
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:20,290
Standard care and cancer and and sort of goes through this but there are dozens and dozens and dozens of studies in

705
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,490
Multiple different kinds of cancers like dozens in each type of cancer

706
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:32,490
Showing efficacy and benefit and and hundreds and animals showing benefit of ketogenic diets in

707
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:36,790
Cancer so you know, it's just and it's just remember the warberg effect

708
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:41,130
Novel prize winner auto warberg showed that cancer cells require

709
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:46,830
400 times the amount of glucose is normal cells and they can't run on ketones

710
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:56,070
So you limit the supply of glucose you limit the energy to those cells and your cells are all fine because your your cells primarily run on ketones

711
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:56,670
anyway

712
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:58,190
so

713
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:03,630
Watch those things. I have a playlist on YouTube on my YouTube channel just

714
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:09,090
Chaffee: Cancer as a lot of videos on cancer and so I would just go through those and

715
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,850
Try to get your family member to watch those because they

716
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:18,650
Will reverse their diabetes and by doing that it will

717
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:24,790
Significantly help their their fight with cancer and help help manage it much better

718
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,990
Good luck with that. I hope they do well

719
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:33,010
Tyler Durant has resurfaced and

720
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:38,190
Thank you for the super chat not seeing a question attached for maybe down the road

721
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:41,670
You wills Anderson thank you very much for the very generous super chat

722
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:48,430
Chaffee: Following your advice Dr. C days six of no coffee previous only one organic coffee in the morning

723
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:56,150
Head pain fatigue light sensitivity woke up during the night with reflux never had that before

724
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:02,110
Had camel mild tea sorry and set up for hours any tips. I mean it's just withdraws you know

725
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:06,730
It's like it's this this is a drug withdrawal and so you know that

726
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:12,490
That does go away your your day six. That's usually the the sort of the tail end of it

727
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:17,710
Chaffee: You know early on if you're if you're really getting really bad headaches if you take like a no dose like a

728
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:24,470
caffeine cap tablet and take like a quarter of that so like 25 milligrams that can take the edge off the headaches in the

729
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:27,470
And the

730
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:31,510
And the different sorts of withdrawal side effects and sort of you know when you off of it

731
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:32,290
quickly

732
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:35,130
But you know

733
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:43,310
Chaffee: You're sort of through most of that at this point most people feel a lot better after the first week the first week is usually the toughest so drink a lot of water

734
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:50,090
Eat me until you're satisfied if you know and and you're almost there. I wouldn't even

735
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:55,450
I wouldn't even recommend taking a tiny amount of caffeine unless you're having just a massive

736
00:57:56,270 --> 00:58:03,830
Splitting headache, but most of the time at at this point you're pretty much through it. So we'll why start that up again? Why start the addiction process up again?

737
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,670
You know, I would just I would just

738
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,410
You you weathered it this far

739
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:11,270
Generally this is the tail end of it. I think you'll do

740
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:16,310
Chaffee: Much better very soon in the next sort of week or so you should be you should be

741
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,970
Through the worst of it and feeling a lot better so good luck with that

742
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,590
The real Carolina guy. Thank you for the super chat

743
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:31,250
Chaffee: I'm about to start carnivore and do not want to lose a lot of weight

744
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:37,170
As I am an optimal for my fitness. I just want to shed body fat any suggestions

745
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,990
Chaffee: Well if you're going to shed body fat you're going to lose weight if you're not putting on muscle

746
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:45,990
Chaffee: But if you're working out and you're and you're doing fitness then the body fat you lose

747
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:50,970
You'll put on muscle mass as well. But if you have excess body fat then you have

748
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:54,190
Unhealthy weight that you don't really want on your body

749
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:59,730
Chaffee: You know the number on the scale doesn't matter what matters is your health and your and your your composition your body composition

750
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,460
That's what really matters and so

751
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:09,910
If you just eat fatty meat till it stops tasting good and you lift weights, you know you should be fine

752
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:11,870
and

753
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:15,380
And you should actually put on muscle as opposed to

754
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,740
Losing it and

755
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,520
You should be fine. So just work out lift weights

756
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:28,500
Eat meat be happy eat until it stops tasting good. You want to get enough nutrients or else yeah, you could you could lose

757
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,080
Chaffee: More lean body mass and you want you won't be able to maintain more lean body mass

758
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,500
You're going to lose inflammation you're going to lose water weight you're going to lose some unhealthy fat

759
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,560
Those all have weight to them and so you're going to lose some weight

760
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,920
But that's not lean body mass. That's not healthy weight. That's weight that you didn't want

761
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,920
And if you're working out if you're exercising if you're lifting weights if you're doing sprinting

762
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,980
You'll put on muscle and

763
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,340
You'll gain muscle and you'll probably gain weight in the long run. So good luck with that

764
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,740
Venetros. Thank you for the super chat

765
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:06,980
Hi, J.V. Have you had an experience with patients who have Lyme disease and how

766
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,960
Carnivore has helped affected them or come across any studies before well

767
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:18,320
Chaffee: You know treating Lyme disease and things like that since the 1800s with red meat and water diet and yes a lot of people have

768
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,460
Come to a carnivore die because of their chronic Lyme disease

769
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:27,140
I've had a number of people on my podcast who have put their Lyme disease into remission

770
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:31,400
by using a carnivore die and you you can find them on their Angela

771
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,710
I'm blanking over last name, but

772
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:45,870
She did I think Rebecca Heishman did as well and a number of others

773
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:52,370
But yeah, if you go to so you can watch those those videos and and you know, they they dramatically improved their

774
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:56,510
Their hell, I mean massively. I mean these these poor ladies were

775
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:00,690
Nearly dead at a certain point and

776
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:04,650
Chaffee: It's completely reversed and have horrible Lyme disease for a long time

777
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:09,490
Chaffee: Gone now or at least so

778
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,730
Chaffee: Reduce that they they don't really notice it anymore and

779
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:19,050
You can watch those for inspiration. You can also go to the older

780
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:20,690
Better

781
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:23,810
The better older

782
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:29,450
Chaffee: Baseball groups such as zero carb health and zeroing in on health that you know like 15

783
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,750
Plus years of data

784
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:38,790
Chaffee: Just go and just join those and go into the search function and just say Lyme disease you'll get tons of threads of people

785
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:43,970
Asking the same questions that you have and getting getting answers from people that have gone through this and

786
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,990
But the answer is yes, it does help

787
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,120
Dark sky. Thank you for the super chat

788
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:57,640
Chaffee: Have you heard any testimonies of people improving from MS or CIDP with carnivore?

789
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:03,500
Chaffee: Yes, absolutely. I mean MS at like any autoimmune disease improves dramatically

790
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,100
On a carnivore diet, but you really have to be very strict is red meat and water very high fat

791
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,980
the brain and the

792
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,800
And the the nervous system

793
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:20,200
The myelination this is made out of fat the myelin is is specifically

794
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,620
Made out of fat so when you have a you know chronic you know demelination process such as MS or CIDP

795
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,300
Chaffee: Then you know you need the building blocks. You need the cholesterol

796
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:35,700
Chaffee: You need the saturated fat need the B12 as well. B12 is required for

797
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:40,160
Milinating your your axons almost everyone is deficient in B12

798
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,920
If you're in the range for B12 you're low on B12

799
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:51,140
Chaffee: That's a fact in America if you're under 540 that's critically low and just that level can cause demelination in it up itself

800
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,200
So if you have a demelination disorder

801
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,280
Chaffee: You really need to make sure that your your B12 is above that really way above that because that's a

802
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:05,420
Critical deficiency you need to be a lot higher than that you need to be double that basically

803
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,680
Critical deficiency in Australia is different units Australia Europe

804
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,320
England things like that

805
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:19,620
It's under 400 that's a critical deficiency that you can get demelination of your of your axons, right?

806
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:28,340
And so you want to be between 12 on 800 and 1200 and those countries in America you want to be between 1100 and

807
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:33,140
1600 right so the reference range is never make it up that high never

808
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:41,060
And then the UK the reference range goes up like 540 right you know 550 something like that is this like no nope

809
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,120
That's not good enough and

810
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:50,300
You know you even Oxford showed that you get get levels below through you know three three 50 something like that

811
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,700
After five years people's brains were shrinking by five percent

812
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:05,300
How are we how are we pretending that that's in the normal range right and it does it goes down like one 30 and a lot of places so it's like clearly that's ridiculous so

813
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,980
Make sure your your B12 is up

814
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,600
Make sure you're just eating fatty meat

815
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,800
Make sure you're just eating red meat because that reduce that's going to be the best thing to do to reduce your antibodies

816
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:26,200
And then there's protocols using vitamin D most people are low and vitamin D too it's very important normal so

817
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:27,720
You know

818
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:33,760
Add in liver for the B12 and vitamin D they even some folate in there although B12's

819
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,360
You depend on what you talk to

820
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:42,320
There's people to think that it's really not about the folate. It's just about the B12 as long as you have enough B12

821
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,600
Folates isn't as much of an issue

822
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:54,080
Chaffee: But then vitamin D all these things exist in abundance in liver so you know just you hit cover all your bases with that

823
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,140
Even taking a B12 shot if you're if you're below that

824
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:02,800
Critical level. I mean just don't mess around just get it get a shot get it taken care of

825
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:08,100
Chaffee: And and you know we might have a nutritional deficiency or an absorption issue you may have a

826
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,100
Chaffee: Pernishes inemia where you're just not going to be able to absorb B12 properly

827
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,620
You need to find that out and you need to make sure that you're

828
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:16,740
Either through injection or under the tongue supplement

829
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,820
Getting enough B12 if you're not able to absorb it properly and

830
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:27,480
Of course B12 doesn't exist in plants or fungus so you need to get it from meat in your diet

831
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,120
But look with that

832
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:36,040
Those are main take home points though. I have a lady that I interviewed who did recover from MS

833
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,320
Very severe case of MS

834
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,040
Dr. Sarah and it's sort of the that so it's called from wheelchair to walking

835
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:47,840
She actually was wheelchair bound and in early 30s she's basically dying and

836
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:51,040
Six months later on a corner board diet on a lion diet with

837
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:56,700
High dose vitamin D she was not only out of her wheelchair, but she was back doing ballet

838
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:03,040
Which is amazing and so that's what she did. She did high dose vitamin D and a lot of red meat and nothing else

839
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,880
Make sure your B12 is up

840
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:12,620
Jump start that with an injection if you need to and then then maintain it and build on that with your diet and make

841
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:17,080
And but check it again because if you have an absorption issue or pernicious anemia

842
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,820
Which is if you have one autoimmune disease you almost certainly have another autoimmune disease

843
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:26,900
And pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease that attacks apart of your stomach that releases intrinsic factor

844
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:33,180
You have to have intrinsic factor to bind to B12 to absorb that complex without intrinsic factor you don't absorb B12

845
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,980
Right so if you

846
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,920
Attacked and damaged that part of your stomach. It makes intrinsic factor because of this autoimmune disease

847
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,980
You know that's just something you need to know about you need to get in regular injections or

848
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,400
under the tongue sub-lingual

849
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:52,600
Supplementations so you can absorb it in another way because you're not going to absorb it through your gut because

850
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,440
You know you've got permanent damage there. Okay, so keep that in mind and check

851
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:01,060
Everyone should check. This applies to a lot of people

852
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:05,440
Chaffee: The the deficiency side of things in the mountain absorption side of things

853
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:10,840
Chaffee: Steven Wells. Thank you for the super chat try general neurology type two

854
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:19,580
Chaffee: Have you heard of anyone with this condition being cured by this diet so it can certainly improve I have seen people improve dramatically

855
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,100
so it's

856
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,460
There are different different causes and there's different sorts of

857
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:34,800
Chaffee: There's different sorts of ideologies for trigeminal neurology

858
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:38,940
Chaffee: But either way whatever's inflaming that trigeminal nerve

859
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:43,430
can be relaxed and calmed and the

860
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:52,900
Information can go down and that can reduce the signal up that nerve and get applying that pain response

861
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,930
So yes it can it can definitely help

862
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:06,220
Chaffee: It depends you know, I mean sometimes you get like an aberrant vessel that can sort of like move and shift around in your brain

863
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:09,500
And sort of like press on the trigeminal nerve and every time it

864
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:16,520
Be to just don't don't don't just hits that trigeminal nerve and you get pain pain pain pain

865
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:21,480
And so sometimes you need surgery you need to go in there and just put a little

866
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,300
Teflon pad

867
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:29,230
Chaffee: In between the the artery and the nerve and then that can

868
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:33,450
That can sort of block that off but yes it can

869
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,660
It can

870
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:43,300
Reduce the inflammation it can reduce the the pain sensation just like it does with a lot of other neurological pain

871
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,460
Pathologies

872
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,780
If you've got something pushing on that nerve though, is that going to reduce it all the way hard to say

873
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:58,420
Chaffee: Just have to see but it it almost certainly will reduce the pain if you're just getting rid of all this other

874
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:05,120
Information because that information increases the pain expression and so whatever pain you have in your body is going to be worse

875
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:12,520
Because of the things that you eat and so if you just cut all those things out then then that will almost always

876
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,300
Reduce the pain but keep in mind that can be

877
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,520
Physical reasons why that could that pain can be there

878
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:30,920
Sue W. Thank you for the super check can Venus stasis and autoimmune neuropathy heal on carnivore three months in having oxillate dumping lots of pain suggestions

879
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:38,140
Chaffee: autoimmune yes absolutely I mean you're damaging the nerves if the nerves are damaged then

880
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,060
They could be permanently damaged and and that pain can still be there

881
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:47,720
But it it should reduce the amount of pain that you have or by reducing the information expression of that pain

882
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:54,020
Giving your ketones up by eating a lot of fat that can further reduce and suppress inflammation

883
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,220
Because high ketones directly suppress

884
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,080
Implamation as well

885
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:04,000
Oxillate dumping can cause pain oxillate double can cause nerve pain cause joint pain can cause

886
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:09,520
Edics and other sorts of things as well so you might have to sort of get through that if it's

887
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:13,000
Too much of a bother you can try saline orton's

888
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:21,120
Protocols about a very low amount of oxillates like a bit of lemon in your water or a bit of

889
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,120
You know weak tea

890
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:30,120
Chaffee: Where you will have to just a bit of oxillates, you know less than a hundred milligrams a day you can look these up and how much these things have

891
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:34,460
You know about 50 to a hundred milligrams tops and

892
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,020
per day and then

893
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:42,220
That can sort of suppress the oxillate dumping if that's actually indeed what's happening

894
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,360
Chaffee: Part of tests for that. We don't we don't have a test to show that your oxillate dumping is just sort of

895
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:48,560
us

896
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:53,300
It's a clinical diagnosis sort of things, you know, and

897
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:55,740
So

898
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,060
Chaffee: But it can help these sorts of things Venus stages depend on what's causing that

899
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,140
But it can help with a lot of

900
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,500
Issues with circulation certainly help with auto immunity

901
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,760
Then the neuropathy and the damage that's happened from that

902
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:14,440
I have to see how much of that heals, but you're at least give your body a chance to heal

903
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,260
And then keep that in mind for the oxillate dumping

904
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:25,040
Hopefully things have gotten better though. Hopefully the pain even though it's severe is it at least better than it was before

905
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:32,880
You switch to this way of eating all to there are other benefits as well focus on those good things and that can help you

906
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,960
You know weather things until your body heals and nothing gets the rest of the problems out as much as they can

907
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,180
So good luck with that. I hope it gets better soon

908
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,600
Jason Warley. Thank you for the super chat

909
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,340
How about healing neurological disorders for example

910
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,900
adrenal lukodisc

911
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:58,220
Chaffee: Trophy uh with spasticity and build up of long chain fatty acids in the in the body symptoms

912
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:03,380
Very good question neurological disorders in general can

913
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:05,940
Be helped. I mean we have studies showing that

914
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:15,380
High fat meat-based ketogenic diets like a carnivore diet. Remember ketogenic diets are all animal-based high fat animal-based diets

915
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:21,400
And a carnivore diet is a high fat animal-based ketogenic diet so anything any studies that talking about the

916
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:27,520
Benefits of a ketogenic diet apply to a carnivore diet that is ketogenic so you're not having

917
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,520
fruit or honey or those sorts of a lot of milk things like that

918
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:36,160
So I don't know specifically for that

919
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,340
Chaffee: I haven't really seen that

920
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:44,740
Chaffee: I have seen pretty remarkable things with people that have had old strokes or even spinal cord

921
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,740
severe spinal cord damage and

922
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,420
Paraplegia or quadruplegia

923
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:58,800
Chaffee: with spasticity or cerebral palsy with spasticity improve their spasticity improve some

924
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:05,810
neurological findings is absolutely incredible so how much of that don't know but it can

925
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,280
It can it can seriously

926
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,320
Improve a lot of these sorts of things so it just depends

927
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,260
A lot of these sort of

928
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:27,300
Chaffee: Issues they they've caused damage to the body damage the neurological system and it's just a matter of

929
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:35,920
You know how how much healing the body can do and so it's um it just sort of some of those things that you just have to sort of

930
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:41,340
wait and see but a lot of things yeah it does help with a lot of a lot of neurological issues absolutely

931
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:47,260
I mean look at look at my interview with Dave Mack he wrote he improved his symptoms from a stroke from a

932
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:53,340
30-year-old stroke after two months on a carnivore diet right he'd done ketone icons before that it didn't

933
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,800
change anything just going carnivore

934
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,200
Two months he was walking normally and didn't have as much weakness nearly as much as weakness there's just sort of normal

935
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,000
Wasn't quite as strong as the left side

936
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:09,000
But it was you know right right side of weakness previously but

937
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:12,820
He it is basically functionally normal now

938
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:16,910
Excuse me and

939
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:20,410
And so you know that that's remarkable so

940
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:23,170
We don't know everything that it can do but

941
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:27,090
We're still learning and definitely it can heal a lot of

942
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,950
neurological issues so

943
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:32,770
Chaffee: It'll at least put you in a position that your body can heal from as much of it as it can

944
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:35,570
And hopefully stop it from getting worse

945
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:43,190
Chaffee: Robby Waller thank you for the super chat my sister's 46 was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Jesus

946
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:48,190
Chaffee: I mean what this was this never existed even in the elderly population and we're saying no no no

947
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,970
Chaffee: It's totally normal blah blah blah

948
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:52,770
Explained 46 rules then

949
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:59,950
These these people piss me off by by dismissing this oh yeah, yeah, it just happens know it

950
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:03,510
damn well doesn't it's not supposed to and

951
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:07,210
You know now we're now we're getting people in their 40s getting Alzheimer's this is just

952
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:10,390
infuriating to me and

953
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:16,910
Chaffee: I normally swear a lot so I hope you people will realize just how much self control that I exert in these videos because I normally

954
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:21,430
Chaffee: So we're a lot I've rugby players on my team that would be like K. O. Chay, if you can you just

955
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:26,530
Chaffee: Tone down the swearing a bit. I mean that's like having a long short amount of telling you you swear too much

956
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:29,130
So I hope you guys appreciate that because

957
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,770
normally I'd I'd be

958
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:35,490
There'd be a lot of expletives involved in in reading something like this

959
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:41,630
However, she chose to do the Mediterranean diet what are your thoughts on our recommendations

960
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:49,170
Chaffee: Well look I mean she's making conscious decisions to improve her her diet and and make up you know positive impact on her health

961
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:54,210
So that's already great and so you know doing Mediterranean diet as long as she's doing

962
01:15:54,210 --> 01:16:02,550
I mean look at the sardinians like they almost essentially all meet with a bit of olives and tomatoes and that's it

963
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:05,810
Look at my video on the blue zones with

964
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:12,730
Dr. Bill Shimler he did a research trip out to sardinia to the epicenter of the first blue zone and actually saw no

965
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:20,070
They're not plant-based. They're not vegetarian. They don't eat meat once a week. They eat meat all day every day with a lot of dairy and

966
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:27,270
So you know that's just a flat out lie by damn mutner. He's a liar. I'll say that publicly. He's a liar

967
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,730
Please try to sue me. I'll sue you back your a liar. You made this shit up

968
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:40,870
You know because he went there and and Bill Shimler talked spoke to the same people that that butner spoke to and they said

969
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:46,270
Chaffee: Why does everyone say we're vegetarian? What the hell? Where the hell did they get that from we meet every day?

970
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:48,090
So he's a liar and

971
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:52,370
And he's a seven-day dentist. He's got a he's got a ideological

972
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:55,650
bone to pick with the way everybody eats

973
01:16:56,250 --> 01:17:02,670
Chaffee: But Saturday that just church bought the blue zone rights for like something like 68 million dollars

974
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:10,470
This is a con these are liars and con artists and they are they are doing things that hurt people and so that bothers me

975
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:15,750
So she's doing a real Mediterranean diet. You know the way that sardinians actually

976
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:17,070
Great

977
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:21,590
But look the main thing is she's making a conscious effort to improve her health

978
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:25,630
Like the hood, she's going to be cutting out a bunch of processed foods and garbage

979
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,590
Seedles and sugars and buying carbs. So that's already really good

980
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:34,790
Chaffee: If you can get her to go key to genic that's even better. I have videos on Alzheimer's

981
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:42,810
Dimension living to past 120 I think it's called and where I talk about this there are studies again

982
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:49,610
These these studies with ketogenic diets are thousands of high-level randomized control trials in ketogenic diets

983
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:54,330
Showing specific with specific health outcomes showing improvement

984
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:59,410
A high-fat meat-based ketogenic diet

985
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:02,430
Like the real Mediterranean diet the sardinians

986
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:09,730
That has been shown to be a better treatment for Alzheimer's than every medication ever trial

987
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:17,570
Right so you really want to get rid of the carbs. So eat meat. The fatty meat the brain is made out of that

988
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:24,910
Chaffee: And so it's made out of cholesterol as well right and we're we're working as hard as we can to lower our cholesterol and

989
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:32,000
Chaffee: Your brains made out of cholesterol and there are studies showing that people have had and certainly case reports of

990
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:36,130
People that had Alzheimer's and they were on statins

991
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:43,110
Chaffee: Stats can cross the blood brain barrier and and stop your brain for making the cholesterol that it uses to build your brain

992
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:45,150
Right are we insane

993
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:50,310
Chaffee: Right, that doesn't get into your blood stream. That doesn't cross the blood brain barrier back the other way

994
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:54,670
It's just being used for the for the building materials of your brain most likely

995
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:56,930
There may be mechanisms they can cross back and forth

996
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:00,470
But it makes it in your brain so your brain can use it in your brain for your brain

997
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:05,050
And we're giving drugs that reduce that stop your brain for me able to make cholesterol

998
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:10,050
Which is how you violate your axons and your nerves and so you can get brain shrinkage

999
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:15,130
You can get damage and you can get insulin resistance so glucose count can't feed the brain

1000
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:23,370
Chaffee: Properly and you see this on pet scans where the glucose is is reduced the signal is reduced in the cortex of the brain with people with all

1001
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:27,350
timer so you go into ketosis ketones don't have that problem

1002
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:33,730
Brain brain wakes up right and then those ketones can actually reform in a fatty acids

1003
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:38,950
Which can then be used to rebuild the structures of the brain the cholesterol can rebuild the structures of the brain as well

1004
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:41,280
needs to has to be there

1005
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,620
And so there's these these in the published literature

1006
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:50,320
Chaffee: They found these people that had Alzheimer's on these statins. They removed the statins six weeks later

1007
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,160
Chaffee: Wouldn't you know they didn't have Alzheimer's anymore?

1008
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,960
Put them back on the statins

1009
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,040
Funny enough they got Alzheimer's again

1010
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:01,120
Isn't that funny you know it's almost as if they're related so

1011
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:08,160
Sorry for the bit of the rant, but I mean this is this is that doesn't need that should never have happened to your sister

1012
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,860
That should this is not be something that we're dealing with at all no one should have to deal with this right now

1013
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:19,300
We have been tricked and controlled and fooled in eating things that are horrible for us because we think they're good for us

1014
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:28,020
And it is causing serious disease and harm and it never existed in any in any real form in humans before

1015
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,560
You know 100 years ago 120 years ago. This is

1016
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:36,260
This is a man-made disease and it is devastating so

1017
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:37,340
But

1018
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,500
Is is if we're causing it we can also

1019
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:44,140
Undo the cause and and hopefully

1020
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:50,400
You can get a lot of improvement from your sister and I would expect she will get a lot of improvement if she's able to go

1021
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,600
High-fat keto even if it's not full of carnivore just get rid of the carbs had in meat and fat and

1022
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:57,660
You know

1023
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:03,560
Keep cholesterol in the brain because the brain needs cholesterol. Okay good luck with that good luck to her

1024
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,160
And damn butner's a liar

1025
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:08,400
Dark sky. Thank you for the super chat

1026
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,560
Could caffeine make autoimmune diseases worse

1027
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:12,800
potentially

1028
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:19,420
It is a neurotoxin. It's an insecticide that plants makes it to to fry the brains of insects

1029
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:24,980
They're trying to eat it so it's not it's not there to help you it is there to hurt you if it

1030
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,740
If you like the effects that's that's a

1031
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:32,360
You know that's that's not the original intention so

1032
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:35,620
You know

1033
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:40,720
To see how you go I mean I if with any autoimmune disease I would just cut out absolutely everything from plants

1034
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,680
I would cut out everything except red meat really

1035
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:48,080
Chaffee: I would I wouldn't be surprised if caffeine did but I don't know specifically if it does one way or the other

1036
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,960
You can always try caffeine coffee will coffee definitely will tea definitely will

1037
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,480
Make autoimmune diseases worse but if you take this a caffeine pill

1038
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,980
Maybe you can you try it out and see for yourself but I would just sort of avoid it on principle really

1039
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,800
Pete thank you very much for the super chat

1040
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,140
Hi Dr. Chafi. I lost

1041
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,120
Something so maybe there's something else here Pete

1042
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:18,900
Okay, so I think I think I think I may have lost some of your of your message

1043
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:26,500
Chaffee: But say life's otherwise good. I do line diet on mad 99% with occasional cheese

1044
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,160
And cream only one socializing how do I stop the weight or belly fat gain? Thank you for all that you do is in another one here

1045
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:42,150
Not that I'm seeing so sorry Pete. I'm not seeing your other part of that question

1046
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:44,530
But

1047
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:48,530
Sounds like you're doing good doing line diet

1048
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:51,730
occasional cheese and cream fair enough

1049
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:59,110
And you're saying you're sort of building up belly fat or maybe not losing it as much

1050
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:02,590
It's hard to know but it looks like stop belly fat

1051
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:05,090
Weight gain

1052
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:11,430
So you need your dress things like sleep and stress those are major months, especially with a belly

1053
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:15,610
You know the the interbdominal fat is is is is a very

1054
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:21,150
Sensitive to cortisol so you raise your cortisol because you're stressed out because you're not sleeping well

1055
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:26,650
You're you're going to not only retain belly fat, but you're going to grow your belly fat

1056
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:31,390
And so you need to you need to address that as well. Um, if you

1057
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:36,970
If you get four to five hours on average of sleep a night for for a week

1058
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:44,690
Seven days you'll actually give yourself diabetes, right? So not good because of how how much that cortisol affects you stress will do that too

1059
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:51,550
If you average seven to eight hours of sleep for the next seven days, you can reverse that

1060
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:54,770
So really optimize and prioritize your sleep

1061
01:23:55,370 --> 01:24:01,050
I try to prioritize your and optimize your stress levels and de-stressing as well very important things

1062
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:07,250
Stress is stress, you know, we we all sort of face it, but you have to try to do things that just make you happy

1063
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:14,030
And de-stress every day and try to get yourself into a situation that's that's more conducive to your your stress levels

1064
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:20,570
And mental health being being benefit of that so and then just give a time

1065
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:26,050
You know, there are reasons hormonally and otherwise that that can be a problem if you're on medications that can also be a problem

1066
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,590
occasional dairy

1067
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:30,230
You know

1068
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:34,650
Probably not that big of a deal, but you know, you're just

1069
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:37,390
Get rid of everything and you're going to be better off

1070
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,110
And

1071
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:42,050
Exercise as well lifting weights

1072
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:45,510
Doing sprints if you can even on a stationary bicycle

1073
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:52,650
That can be very very beneficial and I think can stimulate fat loss and especially belly fat loss

1074
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:57,150
Chronic cardio the other way around that can actually raise your cortisol

1075
01:24:57,150 --> 01:25:02,250
So doing like just long-term stuff on the treadmill or going for long jogs or whatever

1076
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:05,370
That can actually raise your cortisol and make it make this

1077
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:07,630
That loss a bit more stubborn

1078
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:12,410
Sprinting does the opposite just melts away belly fat and interagomal fat in particular

1079
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:18,270
So that's what I would do. I'd add in those sorts of exercises the resistance training the anaerobic training

1080
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:22,510
Chaffee: And high intensity really try to work you know work yourself

1081
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:25,470
very hard within you know safety

1082
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:27,570
reasonable

1083
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,970
amount so that you're not hurting yourself

1084
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:37,270
Chaffee: But you know challenge yourself make yourself work really hard and you know you'll get there just keep going with it and

1085
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:42,810
Chaffee: Cut out everything all artificial sweeteners everything like that sounds like you are but just some of these things sneak in

1086
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:49,970
You know stevia month root sugar even things like on the electrolytes of people supplement with they have artificial sweeteners in a lot of them

1087
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:51,610
So just don't take those ones and

1088
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:57,010
And just keep going with it. You'll do fine again some people just take a bit longer

1089
01:25:57,010 --> 01:26:04,330
Because of their hormones and other sorts of reasons to lose weight, but you'll get there just optimize all those things and keep going you'll do great

1090
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,260
Chaffee: Superfluity of

1091
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:11,440
Chaffee: Notiness whatever that means so

1092
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:19,380
Chaffee: Thank you for the super chat. Can you give a refresher on the efficacy of alleged health benefits of fiber

1093
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:21,380
Chaffee: Also, you will insoluble

1094
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,040
Chaffee: Manicated carnivore

1095
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,740
beautifies food in your gut. Yeah, so the thing is is that

1096
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:34,280
Chaffee: Can't put you to find your gut if it doesn't get to your lower gut right because you're absorbing 98 to 99 to even a hundred percent of the meat that you're eating

1097
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,540
If you cut out the gristle of the of the meat and you just eat the fat

1098
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,600
Soft fat and the soft muscle

1099
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:45,640
None of it none of it's getting down to your lower intestine and to where the bacteria are in the first place, right?

1100
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:47,880
So

1101
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:54,200
Camp future five what does future five is the fiber because you can't break down fiber

1102
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,680
You can't absorb fiber. It has to go out the other end

1103
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:03,660
Chaffee: So it necessarily has to go to your lower intestine because it's a one-way one-way tube and

1104
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:08,820
Chaffee: And that's where the fiber goes and then the bacteria work on it and future flies it and and

1105
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:15,240
You know, and that that's what that's what's getting future five now if you're eating fiber and you're eating food

1106
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:19,080
Plants that have anti-nutrients that block the absorption and digestion of meat

1107
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:23,660
Chaffee: Okay, yeah, then that can get down to your lower intestine and then the bacteria can work on that

1108
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:29,020
Chaffee: But that's the plants fault that's fibers fault fiber causes that it doesn't help that

1109
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:33,240
meat you absorb all of it nearly and

1110
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:39,060
As long as you're not eating it with fiber and other anti-nutrients that that delay or block absorption

1111
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,040
So yeah, and

1112
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:48,620
But yeah, fiber you don't need it. You don't want it. No animal on earth

1113
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:52,490
Each fiber unless they can break it down and get something out of it. We can't

1114
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:59,980
70% of all animal species are carnivores none of them eat fiber in order to be able to defecate or for any other health benefits

1115
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:05,440
It's not necessary it can cause harm and delay up to 30% absorption of the food you're eating

1116
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:09,320
If you're eating high to octane crap, then that might be good

1117
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:17,420
Chaffee: You're going to absorb less carbs. You're going to absorb less sugar. You're going to absorb less of the other garbage because it's a physical barrier and and disrupts your absorption

1118
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:24,760
That's not good if you're eating things that are just good for you, right? So yeah, so that's a short answer

1119
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:30,040
Chaffee: I have a video on fiber conservation and diet the people can watch also Zoey Harkham's

1120
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:38,040
Video what about fiber is excellent as is Dr. Paul Mason's

1121
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:45,080
Video from fiber to the microbiome excellent. They're both excellent and they don't even

1122
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:53,280
Chaffee: They have they're both very complementary to each other. They don't just say the same things all all three of those don't say the same things

1123
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:57,520
Chaffee: They're all sort of looking at it from slightly different angles and talking about it in different ways

1124
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:05,180
Minds more practical on how to you know avoid constipation and all that sort of stuff on carnivore eat more fat and

1125
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:08,860
And how you don't have to have fiber and all these other sorts of things

1126
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:14,760
Those are excellent Zoey Harkham and Paul Mason's especially the fantastic so I will watch those

1127
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:22,680
Chaffee: Richard Bishop. Thank you for the super chat is a carnivore diet safe for an older person who has damaged

1128
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:24,720
Chaffee: liver from Advil and Tylenol

1129
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:30,260
Thank you for being so generous with your time. Oh 100% and it and first won't get the hell off those things

1130
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:34,940
Second of all, you know, this can reduce your pain so you don't need to take those things anymore

1131
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:40,120
Advil tends to damage the kidneys Tylenol tends to damage the little will damage the liver

1132
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:47,020
The combination will really damage your kidneys. So you number one to take those together for more than five days in a row ever and

1133
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:51,860
But you body can heal from a lot of these things

1134
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:57,020
If you have cirrhosis and permanent damage, that's permanent but the rest of the liver

1135
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:01,040
And the kidneys that are that are not permanently damaged can

1136
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,300
Certainly heal and get better and

1137
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:10,440
Yes, it's actually most important for people that are that are having a health issues because you just don't have as much of a threshold to get

1138
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,360
To fix yourself

1139
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:17,880
You know, so you have to be very careful with that. So yes, the optimal diet

1140
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,140
is important

1141
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:28,860
Chaffee: And so hello Ellie Millie and she says that hugs help reduce his stress as well. That's very good point

1142
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:33,960
And yeah, it was some of the was saying that the other day that we watched it like a 20 second hug

1143
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,740
Release his oxytocin a six second or longer kiss

1144
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:39,780
Reduce

1145
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:46,620
Send the oxytocin and presumably help stress levels as well. So that's that's nice too

1146
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:53,080
Chaffee: And and and she sent a very nice super sticker. You don't have to keep doing that. That's very nice of you

1147
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,620
Very very sweet of you. Thank you. Nice to see you

1148
01:30:58,160 --> 01:30:59,200
Um, okay

1149
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:02,900
Steve

1150
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:07,520
573v3

1151
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:14,540
Chaffee: Thank you for the super chat. Some say Dr. JP is making stuff up by saying Brussels sprouts have 130 plus known human carcinogens

1152
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:17,940
Chaffee: What other sources? Yeah, that's just for my my class in

1153
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:20,720
Cancer biology. So that was that was direct from

1154
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:25,500
the professor of cancer biology and and I say that and I preface that

1155
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:30,320
And everything I say like this is what we were taught in that in that class in cancer biology

1156
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,180
So that's that's the source who take it take it or leave it

1157
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:41,180
You know there are there are always a finest out it's super hard. It's just it's just

1158
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:43,140
Chaffee: Drenched in the

1159
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:47,120
Chaffee: You know and and buried in the literature in a lot of places you can see like the Bruce Aims

1160
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:50,240
Paper they found 42 different toxins

1161
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:54,460
Chaffee: 20 of which were shown to be carcinogenic. So what I mean, this is a fact

1162
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:58,840
You know, they do have carcinogens in them you look on the WHO website. They just

1163
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:03,980
Flat out say these different plant toxins can be mutagenic carcinogenic lethal

1164
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:09,380
And and these are in the foods that we eat and so we have to be careful about that

1165
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:15,080
So it's not me making that up the 136 specific

1166
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:19,480
Carcinogens that was from my class in cancer biology

1167
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,140
So you know

1168
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:27,600
Take it or leave it, but you know, there are other places that that do a numerate out different sorts of things

1169
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:32,940
And that's just but I always I always preface that you know by saying this is what was taught to me in class

1170
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:37,980
Chaffee: You say the same thing you know you learn something in anthropology class and this and that and or whatever

1171
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:44,500
You know that's just what you know people learn things in school and I learned that in school

1172
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:51,540
So that's that's my was the source was my professor of cancer biology at the University of Washington in Seattle in the early 2000s

1173
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,620
And so there may be even more than 136 identified now

1174
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:01,440
But you know a lot of books on botany and biology they they they cover the sort of stuff

1175
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,340
You know, so you can take a look at that as well

1176
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:08,200
Jill kitchen thank you for the super chat question. I am only five feet tall

1177
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:12,880
But obviously in a amount of weight to lose do I need to pay attention to calories

1178
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,980
No weight loss yet so I'm a bit worried

1179
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:20,760
No, I don't think so I think you just need to just focus on just pure meat and water

1180
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:27,100
You need the fat you know you don't want to if you're chronically under eating your body's going to actually lower your metabolism

1181
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:33,580
Check your leptin check your fasting insulin check these sorts of things your your metabolism can be

1182
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,400
Pretty botched up and that can make you very difficult and slow to lose weight

1183
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:43,660
Check your thyroid as well there are reasons that these this can happen slowly a lot of people

1184
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:51,120
We'll lose weight right away not everybody does so just just be mindful of that. It's a process you focus on your health

1185
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:52,180
First

1186
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:56,040
Chaffee: Watch my interview with Kelli Hogan watch a lot of interviews with Kelli Hogan

1187
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:59,400
She had this too. She didn't she let she gained weight for six months

1188
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:05,580
But her health was improving. She felt better and then her weight started coming off so it does take time for some people

1189
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:11,580
And watch watch Kelli Hogan stuff for that. She did a video with Charles Washington about people that are

1190
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:15,240
Slow to lose weight and they talked about that on her channel so take a look at that as well

1191
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,860
Low carb low drama. Thank you very much for the generous super chat. I appreciate it

1192
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:25,000
Hi Dr. Chaffee was the best diet for one year old

1193
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
New treatment requirements et cetera. Thank you for all you do well. It's the same

1194
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:35,560
Chaffee: Neutron requirements for the rest of us mammals drink their mothers milk and then they're weined on to their mothers diet and they eat that diet

1195
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:40,780
For the rest of their life and then they wind their children off to that diet as well for us that's fatty meat

1196
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:47,760
So you can start off by by giving them just the meat juices from like a roast or a steak or something like that

1197
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:53,480
Give them a little spoonfuls of that you'll see their eyes go. Oh, that's good because it wants those nutrients a lot of iron and

1198
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,340
And he might earn a lot of other really good nutrients in there

1199
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:59,640
That they'll that they'll want and they'll they'll desire

1200
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,280
So fatty bread meat

1201
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,320
That's that's what they should eat you know

1202
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,740
There's different there's different

1203
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:12,160
discussions on how to do that whether you give them a much bigger piece

1204
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:17,180
Then they could ever choke on and so they're just sort of knowing things off and got a couple teeth

1205
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:22,500
They're just going to be able to scrape off just a bit of that meat that's enough that's appropriate for them

1206
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:27,800
And they can eat that that's going to help their jaw work and their teeth form and their and their jaws form as well

1207
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,280
And that's going to be better for their

1208
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:35,600
Facial structure a little development or jaw development or teeth development as well and certainly get the nutrients you want so fatty meat

1209
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:44,840
Chaffee: Same thing that we all need is just fatty meat and you can sort of you know puree it if you want but you know they need to chew you know that chewing action helps

1210
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:48,700
Develop the jaw and the palate as well and they'll have

1211
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:53,120
much stronger a much broader airways and they won't have

1212
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:59,160
All the breathing issues that that we have as a mainstay now. I think that's what's the same stuff

1213
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:04,300
Chaffee: So it's the same thing that you eat, you know, they can eat too and they're they're much more sensitive

1214
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:12,940
Chaffee: You try to give them a piece of broccoli. They will just just be horrified and so don't just give them give them something that

1215
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:18,620
It's good for them, you know, fatty meat and they need a lot of fat and the meat as well because they their brains are growing

1216
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,980
They need to be in ketosis

1217
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:25,900
Because your brain grows optimally in ketosis because of the ketones are better for your brain

1218
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:29,820
And they also reconstitute in the fatty acids help grow your brain

1219
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:35,140
fetuses are in ketosis nursing babies are in ketosis even though there's lactose

1220
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:39,920
And so it's only when we don't be in a bunch of sugary crap when they they are

1221
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:44,980
Chaffee: Formally low or baby food that they kick out of ketosis and they're eating super soft

1222
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:51,520
Chaffee: Mushy crap their jaw don't develop their their teeth don't develop properly their airways don't develop properly. It's really bad for them

1223
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,140
so

1224
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,660
Don't do that and

1225
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:57,440
They'll do great

1226
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,920
Jewels and just and thank you very much for the super chat

1227
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:14,340
Passing A1 C is 5.3 glucose 4.9 insulin is 10 deficient vitamin C dizzy in in the morning causing cortisol rush

1228
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:17,700
Well vitamin C supplement help insulin cortisol and sleep

1229
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:21,560
B flam butter eggs and water. Thank you for being a great teacher

1230
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:25,140
You know my vitamin C was undetectable and

1231
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:31,280
That don't have scurvy. So the amount of vitamin C that you need is

1232
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,940
Radically reduced when you're on a cardamor diet

1233
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:41,900
And you won't get scurvy because you scurvy is a misdevelopment of collagen and so

1234
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:42,900
it

1235
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,360
It's it's it's required when you don't have

1236
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:52,440
But the appropriate building blocks for collagen. You need to make them to know what you need to make them from scratch

1237
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:56,180
By hydrolyzing proline and lysine and so vitamin C is necessary to

1238
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:02,020
Hydrolyze proline and lysine you get the pre-hydrolyzed forms when you eat meat

1239
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:03,760
It's just when you're eating plants

1240
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:08,880
That you need that you need and you're not getting enough from the meat that you need

1241
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,040
Vitamin C to make that stuff

1242
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,080
So

1243
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:16,380
You don't need that now the caveat being with my vitamin C being

1244
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:21,780
Undetectable is that I was drinking milk for like three days leading up to the test and

1245
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:30,380
Carbohydrates even in from lactose will block that out and will block out the absorption of vitamin C

1246
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,120
So

1247
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:39,160
Chaffee: You know there is vitamin C in meat. There's actually more vitamin C in a gram of and program of liver

1248
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,940
Chaffee: Then there is a program of apples

1249
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:43,500
Right so there's plenty of vitamin C

1250
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:47,980
You don't need it if you want to take some vitamin C. I wouldn't take too much you know like you know

1251
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:51,210
500 milligrams max the day you just don't need as much

1252
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,980
I don't think that it's gonna

1253
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:57,090
necessarily change much to do with your cortisol or anything else but

1254
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:01,620
Chaffee: If you want to try it and you want to see if it makes you feel better and you don't go for it

1255
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:08,580
Chaffee: As long as you're not taking too much you're excessive vitamin C actually turns into oxillates in your body and you can actually get oxillite problem

1256
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:10,650
So just be mindful of that as well

1257
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:15,740
Chaffee: Westfield. Thank you very much for the super sticker. I appreciate that

1258
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:22,940
Chaffee: Low carb low drama. Thank you for the super chat watching your live Q&A on my iPad while walking around Singapore airport

1259
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:29,740
Earlier this week was exhilarating. Thank you for making a possible well. Thank you very much. I appreciate that and that's and that's fun

1260
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:34,940
That's your well the people are really care or what I have to say

1261
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:39,100
And that they're finding it useful and helpful. So thank you very much for that

1262
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:44,940
Chaffee: Jason Moreley. Thank you very much for the the very generous super chat. I appreciate that

1263
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,380
What your thoughts on carnivore healing exhale D

1264
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,960
adrenal ducodot

1265
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,840
dystrophia with symptoms such as

1266
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,100
Chaffee: Fastestity low cortisol and

1267
01:39:56,100 --> 01:40:00,200
Chaffee: very long chain fatty acid build up too high of fat like 80% makes me dizzy

1268
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:06,660
Chaffee: So I think he's going back to the other one just just remember everybody that there is a bit of a delay between when I

1269
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:08,640
Get a question when I can answer a question

1270
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:14,180
Because it takes me longer to answer a question than it takes people to write them and so there's a there's a backlog

1271
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:18,340
But I do I do get to all the super chats especially and I try to do the other ones too

1272
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:26,520
Chaffee: So I sort of answered this before but also just add on to that you know if you are

1273
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:31,280
Chaffee: If you're getting a certain amount of fat and that's making you dizzy or giving you some sort of symptoms

1274
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,140
Chaffee: You're just don't eat that much. That's fine

1275
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:35,780
Generally eating more fat than your body can absorb you just

1276
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,460
Excreate it and you can get diarrhea

1277
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:43,000
It usually doesn't affect you physically otherwise except for the the loose stools

1278
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:48,820
So that's interesting that that makes you dizzy. That's that's something I haven't heard of before

1279
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:56,040
Chaffee: Generally you just physically can't absorb it so it's not gonna get in your body unless you're taking things like oxbile and then you'll force it to go in your body

1280
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:57,760
So don't do that

1281
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:02,800
Just eat the amount of fat that's right for your body. So you think the amount of fat that that gets you

1282
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,880
soft stools but not loose stools and

1283
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:07,540
and enough

1284
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:13,180
Meet as well being any sort of state of ketosis and carnivore can actually

1285
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:19,300
Chaffee: Optimize your cortisol as well as your other hormones so people with metabolic syndrome

1286
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:22,160
Chaffee: Actually tend to have low cortisol two low of cortisol and

1287
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:29,260
Not can reverse by putting people on a carnivore diet. He degenerate that because that reverses the metabolic syndrome

1288
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:30,960
And their cortisol comes up slightly

1289
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,340
Chaffee: But then people say oh my god is coming up too hot? No, no, no, it comes up but it doesn't come up to

1290
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:43,640
Cushing's disease levels. It comes up to normal physiological levels and so and then it stays there it doesn't just keep keep keep keep going up

1291
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:46,380
So it can't help with that

1292
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,920
Could potentially help with the spasticity as well

1293
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,560
As I mentioned with people with stroke and and all of that

1294
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:54,680
Um

1295
01:41:55,780 --> 01:42:01,140
Chaffee: And then we have a couple of superstakers from Oz Gal very very nice of you. Thank you very much for that

1296
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,480
And Nick Johnson who's

1297
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:08,240
Very kind to to send the superstakers as well

1298
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:11,020
And

1299
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:17,240
So I think I just done then of course my little Ellie Milley

1300
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:21,040
We send very nice super sticker. Thank you very very much for that

1301
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:27,900
Chaffee: All right everyone. I think I have to stop there that that's all the super chat. So I'm glad I got through all those

1302
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:33,560
But it's 1115 and I was supposed to stop at 11. So I need to I need to hop off

1303
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:37,760
And get to my appointment and get to work and

1304
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:41,020
And then I've got a seminar actually tomorrow here in Perth

1305
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,020
Where I'm giving another top revenue

1306
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,580
Intake for patients a new patient intake seminar

1307
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:50,540
Tomorrow so for people going to that

1308
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,720
We'll see you there and

1309
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:59,620
Otherwise I will see you all next week for my premiere of the new episode on

1310
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:07,340
Sunday Monday Sunday in America Monday here and then the the next live which will be my Wednesday

1311
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,500
America's Tuesday

1312
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:10,740
So

1313
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:15,960
Chaffee: Thank you all very much. Thank you very much Al for for watching as usual. Thank you very much

1314
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:20,280
Melissa and Rick and Darvett and all the other mods for helping out

1315
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:25,640
Always great to have you guys help out and certainly better than it was before when

1316
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:29,740
There's a bit of chaos and weirdness on the jazz and we didn't have mods

1317
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:36,360
So thank you very much is very very nice of you to help out. I really appreciate you all and

1318
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:39,280
Big round of applause for the moderator. Thank you

1319
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:42,380
So thank you very much

1320
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:50,100
We'll see you again soon. I'm also releasing another video tomorrow with my friend

1321
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,340
Tyler from the the big the

1322
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:58,120
Roddevoo city round up so the beef beef round up in Wyoming that I went to last year

1323
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:02,640
Chaffee: Which was awesome. I had a great time there. I just just Wyoming was gorgeous for people

1324
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:06,620
You know this is where yellowstone is where the T-tons are it's absolutely stunning country

1325
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:12,120
You know it's it's a very large state in America and it has like 300,000 people

1326
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:17,560
It's like things like the third largest state something something massive. They big state and it's

1327
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:22,520
It's it's one of the least populous. So it is just gorgeous pristine wilderness and

1328
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:28,260
Chaffee: So Ellen I went there last year. We're going again this year in end of August. It's like August

1329
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:31,020
24th I think is that is that weekend

1330
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:36,060
It's amazing and so it's trying to make it like a big carnivore event and

1331
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:40,680
And they've sort of they're actually officially renaming their town

1332
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:44,440
They're not renaming it, but they're so their town motto is going to be officially

1333
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,300
Set as the most carnivore friendly city in the world

1334
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:50,320
Which has got a cool so that's riverton

1335
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:56,120
Wyoming that's going to be so I was staying more towards we were staying more towards the T-tons in the national parks by

1336
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:01,480
Sort of like an hour or so outside of of Jackson Hole

1337
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:06,340
Which cool little town and that's like sort of an hour or two

1338
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,600
Sort of yeah probably around two hours to riverton

1339
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,020
Sort of drove over there stayed there for a bit and then went back

1340
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,820
And stayed out by the

1341
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:20,840
Chaffee: The national parks and then then drove around and and just saw a lot of really cool stuff

1342
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:24,420
Chaffee: The national parks which was really really amazing so people want to go to that

1343
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:26,460
It's fantastic go to

1344
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,120
beefroundup.com

1345
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:35,500
And I think that the website's being built, but you know just you know

1346
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:40,800
What we'll talk about it more in that that video is going to be released tomorrow

Chaffee: So be there as well and I'll be having her on my podcast too. I was just on hers and I'll have her on as well. She's great. So

1357
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:30,860
Yeah, so be a lot of fun and

1358
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:33,320
And they're trying to make it like a big

1359
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:36,120
Carnivore event every year and it's worth going

1360
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:41,700
Because it's a awesome part of the country and Rosalind if you're still here

1361
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:46,820

1364
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:02,920
Okay, thank you all very much. It's been a pleasure

1365
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,200
Love you all see you later
