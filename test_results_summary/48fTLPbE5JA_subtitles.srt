1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
Is it good to do that? Hello, we are live. It's midday and yes, we are doing it later at 7 p.m.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,700
So if you have tuned in and thought, oh, I'd really like my Sunday evenings in the UK listening to these two fellas.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,880
Well, we're still doing that as well. And we're just waiting for Mr Anthony Chaffee to arrive.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,900
But of course, let's introduce Richard Smith in case you don't know Richard. Richard, do you want to say hello?

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,160
Hello, nobody knows who I am.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,440
Oh, they do. You've got six and a half thousand subscribers, I think. And I did an interview the other day

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,820
I mentioned you and there's always such a lot of people in the comments saying, I've not heard of him, but I'm going to go and find his channel now.

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:51,700
So, I should have a little extra bump there. And of course, they're going to know you at the Easter weekend, aren't they?

9
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,240
By the way, you and I are going to be at the wall on health.

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,460
Spot on. Yeah, wall on health. The end of this month, 30th and 31st of March.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,300
Two-day event, some fantastic speakers lined up. Super excited. I still haven't written my presentation yet,

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,700
but I don't dare, Richard. But I know what I'll be talking about. It's just I find that

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:26,600
having visual aids helps explain things. So, the talk is is down to a tea hopefully within my head, but it

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,480
yeah, I just need to put it on onto onto those slides to present. Yeah, as you've got a

15
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,580
fact to do. Sorry, come. You've got a fantastic talk lined up as well?

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,880
Yes, well, I've been a goody, goody two-shoes and a little girly swap. And I've done my presentation,

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,840
sent it off to film the wall on health men. And yeah, I think it's going to be good. I'm going to be

18
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,760
talking about bloods. That's my presentation. It's going to be talking about the context of bloods

19
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,280
and how it's different when you're a carnival, when you're low-carb, when you're keto, and how

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,780
you can interpret them differently. And I mean at that back-up, that's my book there,

21
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,420
which is doing very well. I've got to blood tests in that context. So, I mean, that's one of the

22
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,820
things I'm looking forward to is actually getting out and seeing some people face to face rather than

23
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,700
being online. And then they can see, this isn't a filter. I've just got two white lights.

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,700
And I blew light behind me. And some people seem to think that I don't want to be out in the world,

25
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,460
well, but I'd much prefer that for becoming rich. Well, a thousand people this way can't

26
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:45,980
be rather than how many people at the conference. And of course, we've got a lot of people tuning

27
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,720
in him because they would like to see Dr. Anthony Chaffey, who was just passing it.

28
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,040
Yeah, he's just massaged to say he is now logging in, so keep your eyes peeled.

29
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,080
Oh, that was a nice backstage. So, let's bring it on, shall we? Can we bring him on?

30
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,180
Yeah, why not?

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Oh, everyone. How are you doing? How are you both doing? Yes, really well. You?

32
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:20,120
Yeah, good. Good, good. It's not like there. Yeah, good. So, it's 8 p.m. with you. I think.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,280
Yeah, it is. So, another late one. So, well appreciate it. Thanks for coming on. I know it's a little bit

34
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,320
awkward with you with the time difference, but great to see you. Oh, yeah, good. You guys.

35
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,860
Yeah, looking forward. Looking forward. Before we kick off, Steve, should we jump on to

36
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,860
what we were just speaking about in regards to events? So, Dr. Chaffey's coming to the UK?

37
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,380
Oh, yeah. Yeah, for the PhD event. So, do you want to talk a little bit about that?

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,120
Anthony, and then we'll go from there. So, yeah. So, the PhD conference is in

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,700
London this year, and that is what we can, is that it's May,

40
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:11,100
yeah, like the 18th and 19th that we can, like 17th, 18th and 19th. So, that's a big,

41
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,880
that's the the biggest annual conference that the public health collaboration have.

42
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,180
There's will be a ton of speakers, so people from the US and from Europe and Australia,

43
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,520
coming over to speak at that. So, the public health collaboration is, you know, they

44
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:38,220
really just trying to be both a grassroots movement to get people healthier and get the information.

45
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,060
And, you know, just the, you know, the best information that they can, so that people can

46
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,900
can fix their health and fix the health care system from the inside out, get other doctors on

47
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,740
so that they can see what they, you know, different sorts of tools that they can use to get

48
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,220
their patient's healthy and to try to affect political change as well, although that's always

49
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,660
difficult with all the, with all the special interests and money involved in politics, but, you know,

50
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,660
you can get people interested in these sorts of things when you get enough grassroots support.

51
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,040
Chaffee: So, that's sort of the idea there. And, yeah, so it would be my first one, I tried to go last year,

52
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,380
Chaffee: but then I had some these issues and I was grounded in, in Australia. So, this year, it's not a

53
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:30,400
problem and I'll be able to, uh, be able to come. So, are we great? Fantastic. Looking forward.

54
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,920
Thanks. Looking forward. Yeah. We've got tons of questions, of course, and a few people have

55
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,240
asked a question. Can I ask questions? So, yes, because it's a lot of question and answer thing.

56
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,740
It's not a live answer. So, uh, yeah, I wrote your questions. Um, if you could keep them to, to

57
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,320
carnival, that would be really handy as well, or key to a low-car, because there are some odd

58
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,460
questions, but I'll throw them at you and to the anyway, because why not, you know, it's Sunday.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,300
So, I have the first question, you ready for this? Dr. Chavy?

60
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,950
So, yeah, sounds good. Okay, right. Hi, guys. I'm a long-term

61
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,310
Crohn's sufferer. We have an angel last week, uh, asked for me. After watching you and others,

62
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,790
I've started to think I could be cured on carnival. What's your views on this being possible?

63
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:29,890
My doctor says no. Uh, well, you know, most of the teaching would be, you know, that they would

64
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,110
say that, and that's, you know, a perfect one understandable bit that is coming from that point of

65
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,050
view, but no, that's that's absolutely possible. Um, you know, you need to be very, very strict.

66
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,970
Chaffee: You need to be on just red meat and water only. This is something that people have been using since

67
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:52,310
Chaffee: the 1800s. Um, there have been, you know, gastroenterologists in 1970s, uh, named Walter,

68
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,910
Dr. Walter Volklin. Don't know if that's pronouncing it right, but that's how I'm guessing with

69
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,570
it's with the weird spelling. And, uh, he wrote a book called The Stone Age Diet where he talked

70
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:08,430
about how humans are carnivores. Here's the, here's the evidence for that. And all these diseases

71
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,830
were treating now, basically a product of, of eating the wrong thing. And, you know, he, as a

72
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,850
gastroenterologist, was was pointing out that there's different diseases that he treated basically

73
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,090
if you didn't eat plants, you, you wouldn't need him as a, as a specialty as a profession.

74
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:32,030
But there, there are control trials and interventional trials and humans showing that

75
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,810
Crohn's disease in particular is very affected by diet, massively affected by diet. There are two

76
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:45,090
studies in particular. I think it very interesting. One was an interventional trial with, uh,

77
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,830
what's called an elemental diet and this person might be knowledgeable of this, maybe something

78
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,350
that he's tried before. It was, it was, something developed for ketogenic kids, or, sorry,

79
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,350
kids with epilepsy, so they were genetic ketogenic, but they're just the elements, right? So the

80
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,890
macronutrients micronutrients that you need, uh, to survive. And nothing else, and it's generally

81
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,350
ketogenic. So you just take this shake, it's very processed, but it's, you know, it's just the macros

82
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:17,530
and macros and macros and nothing else. And they found that that was a better treatment for Crohn's

83
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,390
disease for an acute clot flare, but Crohn's disease that then prednisone, so steroids,

84
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:29,110
prednisone into UK and Australia. Um, so just not eating certain things was a better treatment than

85
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:34,250
steroids, which is the gold standard for getting someone out of, out of the bad flare up. Um, so

86
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,910
obviously that has, the update has a lot to do with this changing something that you, it seems to be

87
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:45,890
have a cause and effect relationship. You remove something, problem goes away. You return that

88
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,310
something, problem comes back directly. That's a cause and effect relationship. There was another study

89
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:58,830
that just removed carbohydrates and fiber and saw how long, you know, try to see how long

90
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,890
people would, would go into, stay in remission without medications. And some of the parts of

91
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,830
this bit in state and remission without medications up to 51 months, um, which is over four

92
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,370
years. So that's, uh, that's quite a long time with, with, in full, in full remission, um, with

93
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,950
just dietary changes. And contrast that with those who did not come out of, uh, of, um, come off

94
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:29,010
and fiber, they, they stayed in remission average zero months, right? There's a big contrast there.

95
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:35,170
So yes, of course, diet has, has everything to do with this disease, as with all other

96
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:42,230
autoimmune diseases, my opinion, but especially the cost. I mean, like you, how can you say that

97
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,310
that the food that you eat that passes through that organ does not affect that organ in any way

98
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,690
perform? I mean, you have to sort of, you have to, you have to, you have to wonder if the person's

99
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:58,090
really thinking that through, um, but of course it does. And there are, there are studies that say that.

100
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,970
Now, that's not what's taught in gastroenterology,

101
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,490
residences, because that doesn't sell pills. And so, you know, there's a product at the end of

102
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:18,290
that. So you don't have a multimillion dollar marketing firm budgeted out to, to push this out and

103
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,010
things get them on to a certain diet, no more crumbs. You know, there's no money. You know,

104
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,450
there's no, there's no money at the end of that. So no one's going to spend the money marketing

105
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,570
and getting reps out to gastroenterologists say, oh, who use my product? Here's this thing,

106
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,570
Chaffee: just tell people to buy meat. I don't know if the cattleman's association wants to get on that,

107
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:45,010
but, you know, if it's, um, but if someone has, you know, an interest in that can figure out

108
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,870
some way of monetize that, get in there. Because, you know, this is, this is a better treatment

109
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:57,330
than steroids. And it's a hell of a lot less expensive than the biologic agents that they

110
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:05,230
they use as well, which are quite harmful in a number of different ways. And yes, can help people

111
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,430
disorder lesser of two evils, but you know, you're not winning this situation. It's horribly

112
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,570
expensive. It has a lot of side effects. And then you still have this issue. And you're only treating

113
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,410
the, you know, you're only treating the symptoms. You're not actually counteracting the disease

114
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:26,730
whereas when you're just the diet, you are addressing the root cause mechanism. As can be seen,

115
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,010
you remove certain things from the diet, disease goes away. That's a cause and effect relationship.

116
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,950
So you address the root cause. Obviously, that's always going to be the best answer.

117
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,390
Yeah, that's great, Anthony. So this, this is where I go with the common sense.

118
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,490
Basically, I have clients that come to me with Crohn's, they go kind of, and they've got it anymore.

119
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:54,010
You know, that's sort of proof. And normally, they say, I've tried everything. I mean, that's

120
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,450
really common thing that they say. I literally, this is my last chance to do, you know, something

121
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:04,930
like that. I've tried every sort of diet and they try carnival and they can't believe that, you know,

122
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,650
and they've had all these problems, all these gut, you know, issues, crones in particular,

123
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,190
as one that always comes up, at least once a month, they get a client that's struggling with it.

124
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,510
And they, this way, and it goes. And some of them look a bit bitter that I've been told about this

125
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,770
way of eating. And the best ones, actually, are the ones that are skeptical. They come to it,

126
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,870
thinking, what I'm going to do here, I don't think is good for me. And they do it, and they can't

127
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:36,790
believe it. So they're sort of reluctant carnivores at first, they tend to come round to it.

128
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,990
Rich, I can't bear you being quiet for so long, mate. So do you want to chime in a bit?

129
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,510
Nobody wants to listen to me chat in when Dr. Chief is on onboard, right?

130
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,650
No, just to add really quickly, I mean, it makes perfect sense. We look for these magic

131
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:58,270
pedals, but as Anthony says, it's, you know, addressed the root cause and these issues go away,

132
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,950
these issues are caused by an inflammatory basis and intestinal permeability. And this is what

133
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,810
plants do. They cause a intestinal permeability and they cause lots of inflammation, remove those two

134
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,770
factors. And everything else just clears up and goes away. Eat meat next time. It's a simple as that.

135
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,730
So I'm going to put some of the comments up because, you know, they are pertinent to what we're

136
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:25,530
talking about. Coffers Carnival Kitchen Aussies meet Dr. Chief in person, regenerate regenerate

137
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:32,010
health summit and that's in Melbourne on the 21st of April. So thanks for that. It's always good to

138
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:38,810
plug these things so you can meet your heroes in person. Right, he's going to be in Austin as well.

139
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,450
So, right, Dr. Chief, you're all over the place. So we're going to move on to a question.

140
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,050
Now, really, what are your top five favorite movies?

141
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:57,090
Chaffee: Well, I don't know. I think it changes for a very long time. Number one was Ace Ventura.

142
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:04,110
Chaffee: Head replaced that. I don't think I've ever laughed harder at a movie in my entire life than

143
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:10,910
Chaffee: when I watched Ted in the theaters. And I watched it three more times that week. I think I

144
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,170
watched it. The Monday it came out then the Tuesday, then the Wednesday and then the Friday again.

145
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,210
And then I think I watched it only twice the next week. And then I went back and watched

146
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:28,670
Flash Gordon, which is a terrible, terrible movie from 1980. Because I've only seen it as a kid.

147
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:35,550
And so I was watching that just to like augment my, my, my Ted watching experience to, you know,

148
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:43,070
sort of be back in the minds that of that of that movie. And so those are definitely

149
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:49,250
going to be up there. I tend to like comedies, especially what sort of pops up in my head.

150
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,610
But one of my favorite moves for a long time was things like happy Gilmore as well. I'm always

151
00:14:53,610 --> 00:15:00,430
cracking me up. I always thought that was Adam Sandler's best movie. And I mean, there are actual

152
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,810
really good movies that are not, they're not just goofy comedies that I really like. I'm just

153
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:10,990
not really thinking about them. And, um, oh my gosh, why can't I think of anything?

154
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,370
Chaffee: Well, and, and then maybe I'll just put series after that, like the, you know, the original

155
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:27,390
Chaffee: store was the original, uh, three Indiana Jones. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, just stop, stop after that.

156
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:35,130
Yeah, but I watched those hundreds of times as a kid or dozens anyway. But I would like watch,

157
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,410
like the store all the way through and then like start over the beginning and just do that.

158
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,110
You always had like the youngest kid in the house, just basically controlled the TV. And you're just

159
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,730
like, yeah, he's on there again. You know, so that was, that was me for it's high anyway. And then

160
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,770
it was my little brother, uh, with borrowing of all things. I did not, I did not know why the hell

161
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:59,970
you did that. But yeah, it's never into that stupid dinosaur. I know that I know the dinosaur

162
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,910
you mean. Right. Yeah, a proper question. A proper question. A proper question now. Could

163
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:10,090
take an iodine or iodine, depending where you live, cause weight gain in a 65 year old female.

164
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:18,110
Shouldn't, um, you know, if you have, you know, I caution people about about iodine just because

165
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:25,090
you can exacerbate hashing motos and most people, uh, who with thyroid dysfunction don't

166
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,250
don't ever get that checked. And or don't even necessarily know they've had, they have thyroid

167
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,630
dysfunction. So, you know, I just caution people, um, that, you know, if you don't have iodine

168
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:42,590
deficiency, you know, why are you taking iodine? Um, you may. Most people do, but, um, you know,

169
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,330
if, if they're on a like a standard sort of diet, they certainly might anyway. Most people have

170
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:53,270
a lot of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, but you may not. And so if you have, if you don't have,

171
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:59,990
I don't think there's any point in taking it. If you are a bit low and you want to supplement it,

172
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,930
I just, you know, I just, and especially if you're worried about your thyroid, it's like,

173
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,130
oh, my, my thyroid slightly underactive, or could be, could be iodine. What could be,

174
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,650
Chaffee: but it could be something else as well. And so, you know, check, if you have thyroid dysfunction,

175
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,570
Chaffee: then you check yourself for hashing motos. It is way more common than people think. You know,

176
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:23,770
Chaffee: people generally don't look for hashing motos until it's a disaster until the TSA,

177
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,870
Chaffee: just above 10. And then they start investigating and saying, oh, okay, well, why the hell is that happening?

178
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,870
And it's, it's, it's a bit, you know, the horses out of the barn at that point. You know,

179
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:40,310
I mean, you should, you missed your moment. And so, you know, the thyroid is severely damaged at that point

180
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:48,430
and may not ever recover fully. And so, you know, obviously you want to, you know, you want to

181
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,690
get on top of it before that. So I would check in my patient population well before we get to that

182
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,630
mark. If your TSA is above two, it can double your risk of developing thyroid cancers. So obviously,

183
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:05,770
that's not normal. Even though I can go up to 4, 4.5, depending on the area, I can go possibly higher

184
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:11,930
than that. But, you know, just above two is a double your risk of thyroid cancers. So that's obviously

185
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:22,610
not an acceptable range to keep your patients in. So I would check before that. And, and we actually

186
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,670
find quite a lot of people with Hashimoto's, you know, it just hasn't just completely destroyed them.

187
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:33,290
So no, I don't think it's going to raise, you know, make you gain weight. Unless it's sort of

188
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:41,810
around about sort of way that you exacerbated Hashimoto's rows of your antibodies damage your thyroid

189
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,670
you produced less thyroid hormone in that to breast your metabolism. But taking iodine shouldn't

190
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:54,670
directly cause weight gain, no. No, I don't think so. And just add a couple of people, message me,

191
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,810
they're listing in headphones and they can hear, I think they can hear your hands on the mic

192
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:07,610
and to me. So. Really? Okay. Yeah. I don't know. Anyway, right. Yeah, that's it. That's the noise.

193
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:15,410
Thank you. We have a lovely question here, which Richard will be able to answer as well.

194
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:22,410
Greetings to all. What does it exactly mean 24 hour live? What does that mean?

195
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,190
Richard that that is our 24 hour live for 24 hours.

196
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:40,130
So you knew that. And it's a spot on. Relay on on YouTube for 24 hours. Last year, Steven and I

197
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:48,990
did the world's first ever 24 hour live carnivoreathon. It was alive that we discussed. All things

198
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:56,310
carnivore, all things healthy, keep door. We touched based on a little bit also. But it's alive

199
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:01,690
in which we get fantastic guests come on each hour. Dr. Chaffey kindly joined us for three

200
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,290
hours. I think two or three hours last year. I was two. Yeah. All last time. I think three hours.

201
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,690
Yeah. And I would say this time, I was two hours this time. Two this time, I believe.

202
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,070
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Are you scared? I was like, I need to go to sleep.

203
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:22,590
Chaffee: I was up until like three, third in the morning last night, and then up at seven for work today.

204
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:27,350
Chaffee: I was like, I was just like, oh, did I do that to myself again? Okay. That's all right.

205
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,470
And then we have you dragged on on the shows at 8 p.m.

206
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,730
It's time. But we're actually really appreciated. Yeah. Oh, so good.

207
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,530
I mean, I stood for 24 hours like this. That's it. 24 hours. I'm engaged in it. I had to

208
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,190
tell what I nipped to have a pee, basically. But I didn't know you didn't drink, you know,

209
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,950
which I don't think you could do when you're high car or you could only do it when you're

210
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:57,810
fat adapted, I think. But it's, that's it. It's really that simple. 24 hour life stream.

211
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:05,570
We start in UK, I think at 9 a.m. A.m. on the 7th of the 7th. And the idea was that you could

212
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:12,050
remember it because it's 2477, 24 hours on the 7th of the 7th, right? Not 2477, but 2477.

213
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,410
Right. Don't miss that. We got Dr. Anthony Chaffee, of course, top of the bill. And then we've got

214
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:23,550
another supporting people, like Robert Kiltz, you know, and Dr. Sarah Sawd and Philip Evardia.

215
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,790
And we got Sean Baker and tons of other great guests. So I'm already joking there.

216
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,730
Anyway, go into it. No, I have joke from Anthony. You know, my favourite joke or call

217
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:40,810
me joke is, who would you like to have as a guest at a dinner party, a live or dead, and I'm like,

218
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:48,470
someone alive, you know, so yeah, right. Yeah, definitely someone alive and be good.

219
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:56,150
Once a week, man, which is a great pun, why will we all agree that diet, animal based, of course,

220
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:02,290
is very important in achieving good health? What role does Anthony Chaffee think, quantum biology

221
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:11,630
plays? For example, blue, right, blue, light exposure. Yeah. Well, well, I do think that that's important.

222
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:19,770
Chaffee: I mean, we're trying to, we're trying to really cater to our own biology and our make-up.

223
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:25,390
Chaffee: And we are trust real beings. We're not trogledites. We didn't grow up in a cave or deep under the sea,

224
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:32,070
grew up in the sun and on earth. And that's, that's where our bodies are designed to be.

225
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,410
Now does that necessarily mean that we have to do that? No. But it's not surprised me that there's

226
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:42,370
more and more evidence coming out that there is an effect that this has and it could be extremely

227
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:52,210
positive and beneficial. Our circadian rhythm is well and truly tied up with the cycles of light.

228
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:58,510
And we started getting this light pollution in our eyes and he's blue, lights, and white lights,

229
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,810
and things like that in and around our house. And we're screwing that up. Our brains tell

230
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:09,050
what time it is based on a frequency of light that's coming into your eyes and in your brains.

231
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,490
And so, you know, you're, you're messing with that. Your brain doesn't know really what's going on.

232
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,650
You may disrupt your hormones. You may bounce off your circadian rhythm. You may not get

233
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:25,250
your testosterone in the morning. You may not get your cortisol or estrogen or your melatonin

234
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,130
night or your growth hormone. All these sorts of things. There's all these different hormones

235
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:37,930
wrapped in its tons and tons and tons of hormones. But they may not be as able to function properly

236
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:45,190
and be released properly. So I do absolutely think that this is something that is very beneficial

237
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,330
to our health, to try to be out in the sun in the morning, or to try to be outside whenever you

238
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:56,230
can. You know, barefoot, I don't know much about these sorts of things apart from, you know,

239
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:01,290
seeing these things peripherally. And, you know, we're not seeing any reason why I would

240
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:08,530
doubt it. I need to look more into it and speak to people like Dr. Jack Cruz and and start

241
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:14,750
and take a look at a lot of the studies that he talks about and others talk about. But, you know,

242
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:19,330
it's fairly mainstream understanding about how light affects our circadian rhythm

243
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,170
and our hormonal cycles. That's not, that's not fringe. You know, that's been, that's been

244
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:30,590
out there for a very long time. I'm very mainstream scientists such as Andrew Huberman and others

245
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,790
talk about this regularly. But, I mean, this is something that's been around for decades. So

246
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:42,290
I definitely think that that plays a major role in our life. And, I mean, I even just look at

247
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:48,370
how I feel when I go camping for two weeks, but few times I've ever done that. And I've just been,

248
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:55,110
you know, up with the sun and then busy all day and then, you know, doing things outside.

249
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,490
And then light goes down, sun goes down, fire goes on, hanging out. I'm just naturally like,

250
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,830
oh, I just want to go to sleep. I'm not on my phone. I'm not on these screens. I don't have any

251
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:11,270
artificial life besides the fire. And, and I go to sleep. I sleep like an absolute baby like a

252
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:20,310
Chaffee: well well-behaved baby. And something went on all sleep. And, and then I wake up, you know,

253
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,550
Chaffee: with the first crack of light, I get up and I feel great, you know. And when you get into that pattern,

254
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,490
you do that for, you know, a couple weeks. You just feel fantastic at the end of that. You know,

255
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:36,350
Chaffee: you really feel the charge and refresh. So I certainly like that. And something I want to look into

256
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,850
Chaffee: more, but no, I absolutely think that that has a big role to play in our health.

257
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,270
Yeah, and I think I think the people that are skeptical when I talk about that sort of stuff,

258
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,450
I say, have you ever worked in an office where you haven't had a window, and then you've suddenly moved,

259
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:53,130
and it's just got a window. Does that make a difference? There's a real simple thing like that.

260
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,610
Like, well, yeah, actually, my lounge is a bit dark, so I tend to be at the back of my house,

261
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:03,410
where there's French doors. All right, well, there you go. You are just believing that daylight is

262
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:08,430
going to help you because it does. I mean, it seems obvious to me, if you've ever been in a dark room,

263
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:13,170
right, I knew you'd say the dark sort of a pressy room because dark rooms were a pressy

264
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:18,190
for a lot of the time. So I think you're right to talk about all the science there, but sometimes

265
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:23,770
just a real-world experience, and you talk to them and you're camping and all that, and people often

266
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:29,370
sort of say, we have a lot of that person's on holiday, so yeah, but also what I just said,

267
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,990
you can be at work and feel better because you're near a window or you've got a better view,

268
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,670
or it's a sunny day, and you can see the birds, oh, you know, there's so many good things

269
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:44,110
about nature. Right, we've got somebody really thankful for your appearance here, the Paris Simon.

270
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:51,810
Super chat for Dr. Chaffey there. Thanks for all you do, Dr. Chaffey. I'm doing carnivore,

271
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:58,870
but I'm having an all-over body cramping issue. I take a good AMT of electrolytes,

272
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:04,150
amounts of things, along with trace elements, and drink almost a gallon of water per day,

273
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:18,460
Chaffee: could this be oxalate dumping or question mark? Well, cramping potentially quite often cramps

274
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:26,800
Chaffee: are to do with, they could be, they could be electrolytes such as magnesium,

275
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,100
and most people will be low on magnesium if not, you know, probably not outright deficient,

276
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,480
Chaffee: but, you know, lower than they want to be. I don't know if it would be oxalate dumping, although

277
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,020
Chaffee: oxalate dumping can sort of manifest as almost anything is just sort of affect things in a lot of

278
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:56,180
Chaffee: different ways, but generally cramps are dehydration, my experience, and certainly when you are

279
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:06,260
Chaffee: losing too much water and just have required more water throughout your day. And so I tend to

280
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,020
Chaffee: find that even when people are taking electrolytes, they're just not getting any improvement from

281
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,200
that, some do, but, you know, the vast majority of people that I hear about, you know,

282
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,420
Chaffee: so people will just take electrolytes and that does end this fine. But other times, you know,

283
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,160
Chaffee: when you actually hear about it, when people have been taking electrolytes, I mean, trying

284
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Chaffee: these sorts of things and I'm like, look, this is just not helping. Do I take more electrolytes?

285
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,360
What do I do? And to me, it's like, you know, obviously it's not the electrolytes at that point.

286
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,720
You're taking electrolytes. You're covering that. It's almost always dehydration. It's almost always

287
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,700
that they need more water. You know, I understand that you're drinking about a gallon of

288
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,660
a day, and it just may not be enough for your needs at the moment. So I'll just try to ramp that up

289
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,440
Chaffee: and see if you can add that on. If you just feel like you're drowning, like, I just really can't

290
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,080
Chaffee: drink anymore than fair enough, but do try to increase it from there and see how you go

291
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,220
it's probably going to be a short-term thing. You might not need this for a long time, but especially

292
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,860
in some of the months in places like Australia and if you were active and they're outdoors,

293
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,420
you're going to need more water. And if you're transitioning over to a corner of where

294
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:18,520
died, sometimes you can have a higher requirement for water early on. And so most often when people

295
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:24,280
get these cramps, it's because of dehydration, my experience. It can be other things. That's the most common

296
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:31,460
part. And do you think that it's possible to drink too much water and cause dehydration because

297
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,120
your body is expel in the excess water and therefore taking an electrolyte out so you get this

298
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:44,380
vicious circle of overdrinking? Well, you can certainly cause hyponotremia, and so you can flush out

299
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:54,260
too much sodium, and that's not safe. Obviously, that's not that's not good. If you're taking

300
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:00,080
away, but yeah, you can definitely over consume water and then cause a hyponotremia. So we

301
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,420
will need to be careful of that. That affects your brain, generally. It doesn't cause cramps.

302
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,320
Mate, low magnesium can cause cramps. I've never seen the patient in the hospital

303
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,060
that had low sodium or low potassium clinically on blood reports. And we see it in the

304
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:25,700
hospital. You know, Mr. Davis has a low potassium. They don't present with cramping. They have

305
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:31,440
other symptoms. If it gets low enough, if you're showing those below 130, you have extremely

306
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,840
confusing, it's rubble to demon and things like that. So it's actually quite unsafe. But they're

307
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,400
the fargic. They're very sleepy. They're hard to browse them. Very confused and don't know what

308
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,340
the hell is going on. And they're just sort of basically slipping into a coma. So that's pretty obvious,

309
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:56,800
you know, when that happens and the obvious part of it is not body cramps. You know, so when

310
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:06,640
it goes, oh, I need more salt. Yeah, maybe you do, but I don't think that's it's just going to be

311
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:14,040
brilliant. I always have in the works Steve, can I just throw a spanner in the works in regards to

312
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,120
that one? Yeah, please do. I mean, there's never some of the screen. And that's the point of

313
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,340
us being here. Crump in, in my experience is usually a calcium issue, excess calcium and calcium

314
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:31,320
excites the muscle, calcium depletes magnesium. So we can combat this through two ways, either decrease

315
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:38,560
and calcium or increase in the magnesium. The thing with excess calcium is that it also depletes

316
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:45,020
sodium. A gallon seems like a lot to me. And I think it could be the opposite issue. I think

317
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,640
you could be drinking too much water with maybe not the right ratio of electrolytes. It'd be

318
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,040
interesting to find out one how much calcium you consume in. I eat if you live in a carnival

319
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,080
lifestyle and you did not have eggs, you'd be surprised how much calcium that is in an egg is around

320
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:06,120
20 to 25 milligrams per egg of calcium. If we look as nature intended, a piece of beef and everything

321
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:13,360
within nature comes with a set amount or set ratio of electrolytes potassium is really high.

322
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,900
So potassium predominates and it's about four times higher than sodium, then it drops right

323
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:24,500
down to magnesium and below that again is calcium. And a best calcium is an even level with

324
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,820
magnesium and this is how the cell operates. It's a one to one ratio roughly. If we increase the

325
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:36,860
calcium too much with maybe cheese or raw milk or eggs, that can throw that ratio out. And again,

326
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:42,160
that calcium also depletes potassium which can lead to further cramping issues. If you are

327
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:48,160
using electrolytes and the ratio of sodium to potassium is wrong, then that can also lead to cramping

328
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,620
because most of the electrolytes predominates sodium and then they drop right down with a low level of

329
00:32:53,620 --> 00:33:00,160
potassium, but the potassium needs to be almost level to the sodium because excess sodium also

330
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,720
depletes potassium. So you've got all of these contributing factors going on in there. So first of

331
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,420
all I'd look at the calcium, look at the electrolytes make sure that the potassium is not so the

332
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:17,160
ratio that we see with more the electrolytes on the market is say 1,000 milligrams of sodium

333
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,060
and then they'll drop right down to 200 milligrams of potassium. That 200 needs to be at least

334
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:30,240
five and ready for not higher. And that's the closer to one to one ratio, the better. Once you

335
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,740
address those two things, then maybe look at combat in the water intake. And again, as Steven

336
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,100
says, drinking too much water can dehydrate because your flesh and out electrolytes especially

337
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:46,960
if that ratio is wrong in the first place. Calcium is usually the biggest contributing factor as

338
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:54,220
excitery to the muscle. So again, combat with either increase in magnesium or reduce in the calcium.

339
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,080
Thanks for me. Yeah, I hadn't actually heard that Hypercalcemia cause

340
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,000
cramping low Calcemia is certainly does because tetany and you test this, you sort of tap on the

341
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,620
muscle and just through your face will cramp up and things like that, you sort of kind of put

342
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,140
like a turning came in your arm and sort of tap these muscle and all just they'll just cramp up

343
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:23,540
like hell. But you know, you can always check these sorts of things and you're going to just

344
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:29,800
to see where you're at. And you know, if you surely don't need to take a whole bunch of calcium

345
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,360
or anything like that, you know, some people think that they need to take a lot of supplements.

346
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:45,120
You don't generally, well, like specifically calcium, you know, I think that you need to eat a lot of

347
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,900
there's a line that's get calcium to make its milk. Right, you're eating from meat, right? And so they're

348
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:58,340
getting to obviously there's calcium in meat and your body, you know, uses that and efficiently.

349
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,340
Chaffee: As opposed to when you're eating a bunch of plants with anti nutrients and oxidizing,

350
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:08,400
Chaffee: stripping all this calcium out, you need it over abundance in order to overwhelm that and just

351
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,380
Chaffee: get the little that you need. When you're all mammals are weening their, they treat their

352
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,560
Chaffee: milk and then they ween on to the mother's diet and they eat that diet for the rest of their life.

353
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,620
Chaffee: And that's when most of the long bones are growing. So that's when most of this growth is happening.

354
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:32,120
So the, the, the most, uh, calcium demand happens after their ween after they're off milk.

355
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,300
And again, where the hell is the mother getting that calcium to give to the baby in the first place

356
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,860
if the mother's diet is deficient and the child is going to be weened onto the mother's diet.

357
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,400
And that's when most of this, the bones are going to grow and most of the calcium is going to be

358
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,610
be deposited. So, um, yeah, you get onto these sorts of diets. You certainly don't need to take

359
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,980
a lot of calcium supplements unless you have an actual deficiency, like I just don't think

360
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:03,440
Chaffee: people need to supplement as much as, um, as some do, unless they have a deficiency. Now, there's

361
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,000
Chaffee: a lot of people that do have deficiencies. There are a lot of people that that come in and they've just

362
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,240
been on different diets, just, you know, standard diet or a plant-based diet. And they're in a

363
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,360
be deficient. They're going to be very deficient. Horrible diets are going to catch you up,

364
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,840
especially if you include some more high dense parts of the animal, like the organs.

365
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,460
That's that supplements for carnivores is Oregon. But if you're extremely deficient and, you know,

366
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,320
it's sort of at a dangerously low level, you know, sure, you know, go ahead and supplement.

367
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,000
Chaffee: But if you're not, you know, then I don't think that's a good idea. Especially if you're in normal

368
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,360
Chaffee: ranges, there's no point in supplementing if you're in a normal range. And, you know, as people know

369
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,660
Chaffee: from listening to me, the normal range isn't, isn't all that normal, uh, from the reference range.

370
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,160
Chaffee: The reference range are an average for the community that every single lab has a different one.

371
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,760
So, they have, when they're changing the reference range, updating the reference range is

372
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,400
first 2000 people that come in, that is the reference range. And so, that's going to be different

373
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:13,500
every single lab. And as we get sicker and fatter and more malnourished, those ranges just change

374
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,140
and they get worse and worse and worse. And I say, oh, look, you're normal. And, um, you know,

375
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:23,480
but you're comparing yourself to sick malnourished people. So, in actual good ranges, if you're actually

376
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,320
in those actual good ranges, then you definitely don't need to supplement. Yeah, especially with

377
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,780
calcium, I'm always, I'm not a big fan of calcium supplementation, either supplementation or

378
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:40,040
excess in the diet because studies have shown excessive amounts of 700 milligrams per day,

379
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:46,840
can increase risk of cardiovascular disease, where as much as 15%. So, you know, I eat eggs, but

380
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:53,440
I'm well below the 500. And I think if we eat as nature intended, then, you know, these issues tend

381
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,240
to go away, don't they? But not a big fan of calcium supplementation. If we look how nature

382
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,380
intended, you'll need two things in nature that contain high calcium as Dr. Chiefy alluded to there

383
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,920
is eggs, which give birth to animal and milk, mother's breast milk. That's the only

384
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,980
and we're not meant to drink milk past the age of infancy, um, let alone from another animal. So,

385
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:22,000
it, um, these contributing factors, I think, can, can massively impact. And our absorption of

386
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,620
calcium is, or, I would need for it is massively reduced as, as we, as we get older because of

387
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:35,500
vitamin D and K2 and sodium and, um, um, and protein, all of these things

388
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:41,520
build bone and send the calcium into the bone. In fact, calcium absorption to bone is directly

389
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,220
correlated with salt, which a lot of people don't realize. So, we need salt to send calcium to the

390
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,860
bone. So, a deficiency of salt could cause a problem even. Brilliant. And I'm going to plug

391
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:57,620
my book, which talks about normal ranges in the context of, uh, keto and kind of all there. So,

392
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,500
yeah, I've just, occasionally, that diet of blood tests. Anyway, right, um, and I talk about

393
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:09,400
all that sort of stuff. We've got a great question here, which is, um, by the way, this is not

394
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,220
medical advice. It's all for information and educational purposes. Uh, what would be causing me

395
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:21,220
to get nasty bruising veins in my right leg being carnival over a year? I don't lift anything

396
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:31,500
Chaffee: heavy. Um, well, it may not have anything to do with, with a carnivore diet. I don't,

397
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,660
I can't really think of anything that would do that. I mean, generally bruising is caused,

398
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,580
well, it is caused by damage to the blood vessels and capillaries. And, and you bleed out,

399
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,800
Chaffee: you bleed in sort of under the skin. And so, I don't know if you're on any medication that may

400
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,880
Chaffee: increase your risk of bleeding or something like that, but it, it really shouldn't happen unless

401
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,600
sort of bumping it on something or something's damaging it or some sort of trauma. Even

402
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:04,960
Chaffee: even some people have very probable tissue and very thin tissue. And, uh, and it can bruise very

403
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,400
Chaffee: easily, especially if they're on medications like blood thinners or aspirin, which a lot of people are

404
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:18,320
on. Um, but you just don't show up unless you at least had something touch it, push it, hit it. So

405
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,680
it's always happening on the right leg. I would wonder what's going on with that right leg. I can't

406
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:29,980
think of anything to do with a carnivore diet, maybe, maybe Steven and Richard may have some thoughts,

407
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,700
but, um, you know, if you, if you continue to have this right on and on, um, might be worth going

408
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,360
to your doctor and just having them take a look at it and just see what's going on because it's not,

409
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,520
you know, it's a bit odd that you just have continued bruising that same leg if you're not having

410
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:54,020
something hit it or bump it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Rich. Oh, gone. You, you've gone.

411
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,640
Well, I was going to say, yeah, go to the doctor. Exactly what, uh, anti-JFEC sit there and just get your

412
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,280
cotton factors look to. Yeah. We're going to Rich. I'd, I'd question which side of of your body

413
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,620
you sleep on? Um, that might be a fact that you sit with your legs crossed. Uh, is it one? Is it a

414
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:18,560
store for the right, for example? Um, have you lost so much weight that now you can see things that

415
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,820
weren't there prior and are you in all the gristly things on your meat? Are you getting all the collagen?

416
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,060
Are you eating the gristler on the bone and the fatty cuts of the stringy bits on the beef

417
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,020
all of these are really important for building, uh, and forming collagen within the body.

418
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,780
Um, a couple of things to take with there, but it is a strange one. I was especially

419
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:42,620
it was on one side. Yeah. Yeah. That's moving on. I think, um, that's pretty much covered.

420
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:49,160
Uh, we have the next question here, which is, uh, I have Moia Moio. What were kind of or do for me?

421
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:57,920
Well, that's a good question. So that's, um, that's, uh, well, that's a, that's a, that's a complicated,

422
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,480
pathology, but that basically what that has to do with the vessels in the brain can be very

423
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:12,120
friable and so they can get a lot of bleeds. Um, and that can cause, uh, strokes. And so sometimes we do

424
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:21,060
bypass surgery to re-baskularize or, or, you know, bypass certain areas that are better damaged, um,

425
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:29,620
of people with Moia Moia. Uh, I don't know of any, any studies with ketogenic diet,

426
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,880
um, with Moia Moia. Um, so I can't tell you. I can't tell you what's going to happen with that.

427
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:42,600
It's a very rare disease and I just don't know, um, many people who have, I don't think I

428
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,600
know anybody who's tried a carnivore diet with Moia Moia. Maybe one that I spoke to a while ago,

429
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,520
but I don't know how they're doing with that. It's, it's one of those things that, you know,

430
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,080
Chaffee: we don't have a lot of data on everything. This is certainly one that we don't or that I don't know

431
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,460
Chaffee: about. I don't know if anyone else knows about ketogenic diets with Moia Moio. I don't know if

432
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:10,000
you guys even have come across Moia Moio. It's super rare, but it's, um, it's, uh, going to improve

433
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,340
Chaffee: your life in a lot of ways anyway. It's going to improve your Moia Moia. You don't know. Um,

434
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,360
Chaffee: you know, things like Crohn's disease where you remove the food, the food is really causing

435
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:26,600
Chaffee: your body to react and, and, and, and, and make antibodies and attack your body. So that's a

436
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,600
cause and effect relationship. And I can tell you what that's going to do when you, when you go on a

437
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:38,460
carnivore diet, it's, it's going to go away. But with Moia Moia, um, I, I can't say that same thing.

438
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,440
I don't know what the underlying cause is for Moia Moio. So I don't know how, um, a carnivore diet

439
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,840
is going to affect that. I would, what I would imagine is, you know, this is sort of a, uh,

440
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,240
you know, inflammatory sort of condition and this can cause friability of the vessels.

441
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,620
This is going to improve your collagen. This is going to improve your information. This is

442
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,900
going to improve a lot of different things that could contribute to that. But I have absolutely no

443
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,100
idea. The, the best thing to do is just try it. See what happens with it. You're going to feel

444
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:11,680
a thousand times better anyway. You're going to fix a lot of different sorts of things. You know,

445
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,560
none of us here have had Moia Moia and yet we're still doing carnivore because we feel so much

446
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,620
better and our bodies work so much better and our brains work so much better. And so even though

447
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,960
we didn't necessarily reverse something serious like Moia Moia, it's still worth it to a. So I think

448
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:34,200
Chaffee: it will still be worth it to you to do that and very well may help with that. However, it would just be

449
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,560
Chaffee: sort of a wait and see sort of thing. But I don't know what you guys think. Well, I think if anything

450
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:45,100
is, well, I mean, just clarify for people, it's the obstruction of the arteries, arteries at the

451
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:50,180
base of the brain and the cause is unknown. You see, so it's very difficult to answer anything where

452
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,560
the cause is unknown because if you don't know the cause, how can you fix that? But I think what

453
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,720
you're saying, Dr. Chase is, if you, if you deal with your systemic inflammation, you're giving

454
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:08,080
your body the best environment possible to make that condition less troublesome. If you've

455
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:13,640
got an obstruction in the artery, it's there. So if you're then inflamed in your arteries and

456
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:20,620
inflamed around that area, then that blockage is going to be even more restricted, isn't it?

457
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,940
Then the blood flow to the brain is going to be restricted. So you may find going carnivore

458
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:30,300
because you reduce inflammation. You start to feel better. I mean, I'm a great believer in

459
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:35,480
a common sense. It's not going to kill you. It's not going to make it worse. So I think, you know,

460
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:41,660
just trying it and then coming back, actually in six and weeks and saying, yeah, did and we would

461
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,360
like to have a case study. We don't like to have someone who has had that and it has improved because

462
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,660
that's how you start to learn about these things. I mean, I think everybody on the screen admits,

463
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:57,680
we probably know like 1% of what we'd like to know about the body. So, you know, I've not come across

464
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,180
15 years already have five years of doing carnivore coaching. Never had to climb with it. So

465
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,980
I think I can't see it doing anything other than improving situation. Did you want to say

466
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:16,880
to the rich? No, I think you guys have covered up. Okay, Jacqueline's next and she's a newbie,

467
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:23,900
10 weeks into carnivore, well done and I have low blood pressure and feel shaky and no energy.

468
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:28,060
Do I know you can more soaked? I take a lecture like this, but maybe not enough.

469
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:36,600
Chaffee: Yeah, well look, 10 weeks is a wow to have electric issues. But if you have low blood

470
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,200
Chaffee: pressures and feeling shaky, then you can add that can absolutely be from low sodium, low

471
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,480
electrolytes and that can drop your blood pressure. So if you're feeling that, well, you've

472
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,060
already checked your blood pressure. So you know, you have low blood pressure. So,

473
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,900
Chaffee: eat more salt, drink more water and especially when people sometimes is more subtle. So sometimes,

474
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,600
Chaffee: you know, when you get up, you stand up, you have a sort of a head rushing, oh, you feel a bit

475
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,620
sort of woozy and then that recovers. You know, how is everybody, you know, even in normal conditions.

476
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,860
But if that's how many you regularly, that could be because you're getting this postural

477
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:17,240
drop in blood pressure that's that's maintaining and you're not able to overcome that normally.

478
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,660
And so if you have those sorts of things, you should think, am I getting enough salt, am I

479
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:31,050
getting enough water, those sorts of things? Yeah, I agree. And the water, I think was a big

480
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:35,910
contributing factor there because that does help with blood pressure. But salt, yeah, it's the

481
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:42,010
Chaffee: team. So possibly too much potassium, potassium calms a heart. So we want increase the salt.

482
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:45,970
Chaffee: Yeah, and I would question if you are still feeling dizzy, are you eating enough juggling?

483
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:51,750
Are you consuming enough food? Maybe you're not eating enough fat and protein. So a couple

484
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,710
of things to look at there potentially. Yeah, and Jacqueline, I think is actually a member of our

485
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:01,770
school community. So you can always come to our live question and answers and get to more in depth

486
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:06,350
one. Well, obviously we're making the most of having Dr Anthony Chafew with us today. So anyway,

487
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:13,010
I hope those answers helped you. Scott is asking, I think Richard might jump in with this one as well.

488
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:20,210
What do you think about MCT oil and its data use? But Dr Chafew first, as you're the guest?

489
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:26,210
Well, I just tend to avoid it. I don't use it myself. I just try to get animal fats.

490
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:31,990
There may be advantages to MCT oils, but I just, I just like getting

491
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:39,790
natural fats from meat in what I'm eating. I tend to steer clear of some of the plant oils in any

492
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:47,310
case, just because they come along with plant stirrows. If they're out of the plant and they're unsaturated,

493
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:53,430
you know, are they stable or are they oxidized and on these up the sorts of things? I just try to eat

494
00:48:53,430 --> 00:49:02,570
meat and fat in it's whole form. That's my usual go to. Yeah, Richard, as always, I completely agree.

495
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:09,310
I think we should get as many compounds from animal proteins as we can. I am a big lover of

496
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:17,230
MCT, particularly C8, C8, is the 6% of the coconut oil. Again, it does come from plants, but when

497
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:23,810
it's at 99.9% all of the other nasties within that compound have been removed. But there are

498
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:30,330
benefits. MCT is not the healthiest fat, you know, and people believe that it is because of its

499
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:37,110
microbial benefits. It's, in fact, it's the most anti microbial substance available without a

500
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:43,890
doctor's prescription. But it isn't the healthiest. Animal fats are the healthiest for us, but where

501
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:48,990
MCT comes into a league of his own is this ability to convert into key dawns incredibly quickly.

502
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:54,110
Key dawns, the production of BHB. So when we consume the C8, for example, it sends straight to

503
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:57,910
the liver through the patty portal vein, and it's almost instantly converted into beta hydroxybode

504
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:03,790
red. And it will do this, whether you are live in a ketogenic carnival or even a carb lifestyle,

505
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:10,850
it will instantly convert. And therefore, the benefits of the BHB will follow, i.e., the block

506
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:17,430
in of NLRP3 and flammers also lower in inflammation, increase the incidence sensitivity. The

507
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:23,470
key dawns will breach the blood-brain barrier and fill well the brain with energy. It will increase

508
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:29,130
the mechanical efficiency of the heart by as much as 35% and blood flow by as much as 70%. So it does

509
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:37,310
have its benefits. Again, it does come from a plant, but it's a tool for me. It doesn't make a part of

510
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:43,270
my diet, but I do find it beneficial, especially for things like public speaking events where,

511
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:47,250
you know, you may be feeling a little bit tired and you need that energy to the brain. You don't

512
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:52,210
want to drink the coffee because of the acrylicide, and we know Dr. Chief is not a fan of coffee at all,

513
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:56,930
as it causes massive neuroinflammation with him, especially in the legs, if I can remember correctly.

514
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:03,330
Bremstity, that could confer a benefit in that instance, for example, because it's going to supply

515
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:08,430
that our instant energy. But it's a tool. It's the same as everything else. Isn't it?

516
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:12,690
Electolides are a tool. All of these things are tools. Do you need them to be fit and healthy?

517
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:18,310
Or, if you eat nothing but meat, you are going to be considerably fit and healthier than any other

518
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:25,110
point in your life. But all of these things are tools that may confer a benefit as and when you

519
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:29,490
like to use them, you know? Yeah. And it's a brilliant mess out of your will.

520
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:39,150
Chaffee: I always, I always did wonder, and I'm thank you for clarifying that. I was just was a bit nervous

521
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:43,370
Chaffee: with MCT oils. It doesn't come up with a plant sterile. It doesn't come up with all the crap

522
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:48,590
that you don't want. So it does sound like there is some available that you can get pretty pure.

523
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:55,730
So if you are visiting, obviously, which we know you are in May, the PhD, I'll bring some with

524
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:02,810
me for you to try, because I produce it. So I mean, I don't, I haven't just rented that off because

525
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:08,810
it's a sales pitch. And as you know, I produce certain products to help people along their journey.

526
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:18,570
But I do these things because I believe that there is a benefit to use in them. And there is

527
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:25,130
that this is why I produce what I believe to be the world's purest form of electrolytes.

528
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:29,970
And that's something else I'd like to get you to try because we produce in a carnival version,

529
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:34,850
which is all natural ingredients and there's going to be no artificials. And it also contains a

530
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:40,970
compound called AstraZanthin, which is the world's only true and deoxidant. And again,

531
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:46,070
we can chat about that. And if it's something that comes from salmon, but we've produced one

532
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:54,170
of the carnival community specifically that doesn't contain any stevia. The only downside is

533
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,650
the vast majority of the market that are gravitated into a low carb, ketogenic carnival lifestyle,

534
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:04,550
don't want to drink salt water, whereas AstraZanthin would gladly do so. Many people

535
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:11,690
are one step too far, but it's all about these incremental changes. And MCT and electrolytes are,

536
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,790
you know, or they do make up at least part of those incremental changes. And allow people to

537
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:20,050
maintain the journey. And that's what it's all about. It's supposed to stay in the journey,

538
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:25,570
maintain in the journey. If we can't sustain or maintain everything falls apart.

539
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:32,470
Brilliant. Sorry to be like the teacher here, but I'm moving along. We have 547 people and

540
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:37,730
up that 200 questions. So I know we won't get through them all. And if you've put a question on

541
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,210
I think you're very much, if you've done it recently, we're trying to get through them as

542
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:46,590
quick as a possible but we want to give you a proper answer to every question as well. So

543
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:52,590
casten is asking, oh, I mean, caused by lectins, how strong is the scientific data?

544
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:07,550
Well, Richard might have a lot to say on this, but you know, there's, well, there's, it's actually

545
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:14,290
Chaffee: something that we do see. We see these lectins getting into the body and interacting with our body

546
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:19,970
and interacting with our cell. We see it in our gut. We term a gluten is that's binding

547
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:25,090
onto the surface antigens on ourselves. And in the gut, and that can cause damage, leaky gut,

548
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:29,410
and then these little suckers can get in there. So that's been demonstrated. We have demonstrated

549
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:33,630
that these can get in the body. We can see lectins tracking up the vagus nerve into the brain.

550
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:37,750
We can see them that they're binding onto the different carbohydrates and antigens on different

551
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:42,350
Chaffee: cell structures in the body. And then we all of a sudden have this specific immune response

552
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:47,350
with antibodies that are specific. So if they're just sort of attacking something,

553
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:51,690
but now they're attacking something specific, we can look for action-moderate antibodies.

554
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:55,010
We can test for these sorts of things, right? So that means there's some sort of specific

555
00:54:55,010 --> 00:55:02,790
complex on the likely on the thyroid that is that the body is attacking. And then you stop

556
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:10,630
reading these things and antibodies go away. So, you know, in certainly, from a clinical standpoint,

557
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:15,670
you see this again, it causes an effect relationship. You remove these sorts of things. The

558
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:21,070
antibodies just go down and they go away. And you can measure them both in patient symptoms,

559
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:27,210
and also in the actual blood form. You're going to look for these specific antibodies

560
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:34,710
they go away. So I have patients, oh, I don't even know, I estimate over 100 patients with

561
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:40,690
Hashimoto's and a lot of other autoimmune issues, but Hashimoto's being the definitely most

562
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:47,550
prevalent in my in my patient population. And certainly if you have one autoimmune issue,

563
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:54,550
you'd likely have others. So, you know, they will also likely have other autoimmune issues as well,

564
00:55:54,550 --> 00:56:02,250
but at least that many with Hashimoto's. And we measure these things. And so, you know, we

565
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:06,250
change their diet, put them on a carnivore diet, especially like a red meat moderate diet.

566
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,450
And you just look, their antibodies are in the thousands, and then they're in the hundreds,

567
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:14,830
and then they're in the tens, and then they're gone. They're just not registering, they're

568
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:20,230
just undetectable. And that's, and that's what we see. We see this in real time. So, it's,

569
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:26,930
you know, it's certainly enough evidence for me to, you know, do this for my patients,

570
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:31,550
Chaffee: and then regardless of if it's lecturers or if it's something else, either way, when you remove

571
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:38,490
plants, it goes away. And so that's the main thing. You know, do we have as hard of evidence as we

572
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:44,490
want to, you know, maybe maybe not, but it's enough for me to say, we'll look, this is something

573
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:53,190
that, you know, looks like it's a credible mechanism. And when we do it in practice, it works.

574
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,650
And so that's really all it comes down to. I mean, that that's the end of the day. What I'm worried

575
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,390
about is what is going to help my patient, and what is going to get them better, and what's going

576
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:06,410
to get their antibodies down, and get their thyroid functioning again. And so, removal of all

577
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:11,210
plants, including lectins, could be other things that they're reacting to too, certainly even

578
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:17,030
things like dairy, you know, that that trips off auto immunity as well. So there's likely other

579
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:21,570
things that are going on as well. But either way, you remove these things, the problem goes away,

580
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:27,110
and that's what I think is the most important part of this. Excellent. Bishop's deep learning.

581
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:32,830
Thank you for the super chat. For Richard and Anthony, what is the best way to gain muscle on the

582
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:37,310
carnival diet? Work out frequency, fat to protein ratio. Thanks.

583
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:43,790
So I'll just jump in very quickly, and just my general guide is just, you know, you work out

584
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:51,730
hard to get onto an appropriate lifting schedule. You consistently maintain that lifting schedule,

585
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:59,210
and you eat enough. So as far as frequency, sorry, fat to protein ratios, you're still in the same

586
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:04,150
thing, you're sitting, you know, high fat, it's also a high protein diet. You keep eating

587
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,730
till fatty meat stops tasting good. You try to do that a couple times a day, at least to make

588
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:14,050
sure your body's getting enough. And that's certainly for, you know, just the layman or, you know,

589
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,890
the athlete that's not trying to just perfectly sculpt their body, like, so rugby player,

590
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:24,790
sprinter or something like that. That's what worked for me. And, but, you know, Richard is definitely

591
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:29,990
the expert on this on how to actually really make a program here. So be interested to see what

592
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:34,570
he says. Yeah, look, don't overthink it. I think Anthony's hit the net on the head.

593
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:39,190
Protein, always consume protein with fat, every cell in the body is made of protein of fat,

594
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:43,510
and we need the fat with the protein. If you're looking to aim for any numbers,

595
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:48,690
aim for one gram of protein per pound of body weight, and that is a rough estimate. We need to

596
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:58,010
Chaffee: release 0.5 grams per pound, and 0.82 per pound in order to build muscle. So one gram per pound is

597
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:04,970
Chaffee: an ICZ number to remember. If you want to really get into the weeds, concentrate on eccentric

598
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:10,810
movements, train for no longer than an hour, 45 minutes to an hour, four sets ranging from

599
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:17,850
reps of 12 to 16. And again, on eccentric movements, if you are looking to benefit from the

600
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:23,710
M2 activation, consume training them all in, ideally fasted. This is one M2 activation. It takes

601
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:30,150
3.5 to 4 hours for M2 to reset. So again, it maybe 3.5 to 4 hours after that, 3.5 to

602
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:35,410
4 hours after that. And so on. And that way, you can still put in a 12 hour fast, if you wish

603
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:40,690
to do fast in, and this way, you're activated M2 four times, which is an optimal for the

604
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:46,330
building muscle. You don't have to do that every day, but that is maximal. And a lot of research

605
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:52,090
I'm doing recently in regards to building muscle and increasing bone strength and tendon strength.

606
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:57,570
It may be more beneficial to in fact train twice in one day, around 8 hours apart and

607
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:02,650
Chaffee: having the second day off. More to come on that, I'm still researching. I'm looking into this

608
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:08,790
Chaffee: injury guards to my building, my strength up in my legs, because as you guys know,

609
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:12,670
every Sunday started doing running and cycling, so I complete 180 from body building.

610
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:18,030
But there's a couple of tips there to jump on. So it should be plenty to get you started.

611
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:26,810
Brilliant. So when you're saying twice, you're working the same muscle group,

612
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:32,470
twice a day, 8 hours apart. Yeah. So one of the studies I've been looking at is, I can't remember

613
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:38,890
that the lady's name, but she is the world record holder for some 500 odd miles in the shortest

614
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:46,010
time, 100 mile. She's a scientist who's looked into muscle adaptation and bone and tendon adaptation

615
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:51,650
in regards to training frequency. So rather than training every day, which is what a lot of athletes do,

616
01:00:53,030 --> 01:01:00,670
she's looked into training twice in one day, doing the same training split. So the same.

617
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:05,970
So if you were to train for one hour each day, for example, a train half an hour in the morning,

618
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:11,650
half an hour, sort of eight, six to eight hours apart and then have the second day off and this

619
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:17,830
Chaffee: seems to be building most adaptations. The science that I was looking into yesterday, as sad as

620
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:22,830
Chaffee: this sounds, this is what I was doing yesterday afternoon, when everyone else is watching TV and

621
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:28,310
Netflix and so on. I was looking at these research papers. It's incredible stuff. And it also showed

622
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:35,870
that the glycogen muscle glycogen was higher when trained low carb. So this was with athletes who

623
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:41,430
consumed in carb, but they would deplete glycogen and then they would refeed with carb

624
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:47,470
a hydropid. But it showed that the adaptations created in doing so increased their ability to store

625
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:53,390
more muscle glycogen, which goes against everything that we had told from the general standpoint of

626
01:01:53,390 --> 01:02:01,870
training and glycogen storage. But yeah, it's probably a whole other podcast on that when we look

627
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:07,990
into the evidence, but it's incredible research. Yeah, and I'm going to flood my ultra-conditioning

628
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:13,250
program because I've been doing alternate day training for 15 years. And I think Anthony doesn't

629
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:17,290
know this, but I used to be an advanced person of training and I actually got somebody to the

630
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:23,610
Olympics, travelling for I. Nice. So it was better. I can answer some of these questions, but I

631
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:30,970
love to hear Richard. You know, I think it's not sad, but looking at research studies, I guess I do

632
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:39,170
a lot of time. Okay, you're not a loser. It's all right. It's okay. We love you, Mike. We love you.

633
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:45,810
Right. I was going to ask you. Okay, guys, one more thing, just in that same vein, I just saw a

634
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:52,010
excuse me. I just saw, you know, when there's old school body builders, it was like that was that

635
01:02:53,370 --> 01:03:01,970
some of the NAM, some like that's like Mike and something. Anyway. Sorry. But almost certainly.

636
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:08,690
Yeah. And you just want those big ass dudes and he's in the sort of the Arnold era. And he was saying

637
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:15,890
that actually what you want to do, you wanted to just work out once. And you're saying like one set

638
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:21,850
to failure, that's all you needed to do. And then and then rest 72 hours before you do your next

639
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:29,130
Chaffee: work out session. And so you're not even, not even the same muscle group, but just the next set of

640
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:34,870
Chaffee: muscle groups. You want to give your body 72 hours to rest entirely. They want to do that. And if you

641
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:40,370
did two sets of something, then that was yes, you get more for it, but to hurt yourself on your

642
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:44,250
Chaffee: recovery and all that stuff. I don't know if he was doing carnivores or something like that,

643
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:50,270
Chaffee: a lot of them were doing steak and eggs back then and lots of steroids. But so I don't know what

644
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:54,950
combination here is that there's going to be a winner, but just what I wonder what your thoughts

645
01:03:54,950 --> 01:04:02,270
are on that. Because I certainly in my own experience, I've always had better results in my strength,

646
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:07,630
physique, and my performance. If I work my muscle groups out twice a week, that's what I found

647
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:13,670
Chaffee: work best for me. And that's why I set up my workout routine around that. So I do the same

648
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:17,850
Chaffee: muscle group twice a week. And that's what I felt work best. But it's always interesting to hear

649
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:25,110
those thoughts. Yeah, I think we build when we recover. We're not building muscle when we are training.

650
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:30,410
So recovery is incredibly important. What I found was nothing worked for me on a seven day week.

651
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:37,210
So rather than training twice a week, I would train twice every eight days. So things seem to work

652
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:43,810
on an eight-day cycle. So I would never have set days for training. But I would alternate a muscle

653
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:49,290
and the reason for that is giving that rest in between. So you'd hit chest on on a

654
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:55,430
Monday, for example. And then I wouldn't train that till four days later. Legs sometimes took a

655
01:04:55,430 --> 01:05:01,330
little bit longer. But again, that healing period is really important. I can imagine why

656
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:06,990
resting for 72 hours would work because you cause in a lot of damage. But then the issue with

657
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:11,650
going too heavy also is that when you're lifting too heavy, it does cause more damage.

658
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:18,550
This is why I moved away from the heavy weights. Always to failure. But eccentric movements

659
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:24,550
were really important for me because that time and attention was last in longer. And we're actually

660
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:29,990
stronger on eccentric movements rather than concentric. So that not only allowed me to build

661
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:35,470
muscle as in physique wise, but it helped build a lot of strength. And a lot of people don't know this.

662
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:44,010
But when I came away from the bodybuilding, I'm 20k like there. So I'm absolutely tiny compared to

663
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:48,110
what I was when I was bodybuilding. But when I came away from that, I was

664
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:54,510
with what I could lift, I would have been in the top 10 in the UK in powerlifting. And

665
01:05:55,070 --> 01:06:01,390
that is between everyone which is the clean and dirty feds i.e. supplemented with anabolic

666
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:06,570
and not. And obviously I don't take anabolic. So I was in the top 10 or would have been in the top 10.

667
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:12,890
And that's what I was going to gravitate into. But I got pulled into the world of running and

668
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:19,110
cycling and training for duathlons and triathlons. So I complete one AD from bodybuilding. But

669
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:25,630
I do feel a lot thicker and healthier for doing so. And something you mentioned recently, Anthony,

670
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:32,570
is that, you know, you and I don't train an awful lot yet. In a vest, I'm still big for a runner.

671
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:38,350
Chaffee: I've still got the delts and the lats. I'm small, but I've still I'm still holding the muscle

672
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:43,390
Chaffee: without even training. And my brother mentioned to me recently that I still look fairly

673
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:48,030
shapely for someone that doesn't lift any weights and hasn't lifted a weight in a year and a half.

674
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:52,930
And that just adds weight to the fact that living the carnival lifestyle muscles precious,

675
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:58,250
the body doesn't want to waste it. And when you do retain and I believe it's more to do with

676
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:03,550
volume in the muscle than actually muscle size itself. Because when I've tested even though I've

677
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:10,210
lost 20k, my dry protein has only come down by 2k. So my dry, yes, I've lost muscle because I'm

678
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:15,310
not using it. But that 2k in a year and a half throughout my whole body doesn't sound like an awful

679
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:20,970
lot. And when we put that fluid back into the muscle, I eat through stimulation training.

680
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:27,690
I believe that I could get back to a physique that I was once in, incredibly quickly. Maybe

681
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:32,190
a test for a future to see how quickly we could do that. But muscles precious isn't there.

682
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:37,870
So we don't lose it as much as people think. I think a days off are under estimated because

683
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:42,010
they're not days off. They're recovery days. The recovery days are logical. Response are training

684
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:47,030
response to what you've done is really important. And it's a big hot topic at the moment in

685
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:53,470
Premier League soccer because there's teams playing you know every three days. And we're seeing

686
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:59,970
lots and lots of injuries. So even prime athletes and prime sports people need those recovery days.

687
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:04,970
So we get to this one so long after you've posted. But thank you very much for the super chat.

688
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:10,090
Someone I know was diagnosed with glioblastoma stage four about nine months ago.

689
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:15,830
Would a standard kind of a diet be fine to try or should it modified because of the cancer?

690
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:18,530
I have seen some of your videos with survivors.

691
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:31,120
Chaffee: Well, no, it doesn't need to be modified in in, you know, really an insignificant way.

692
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:36,780
Chaffee: The only modification you need to make is in respect to the GKI. So glico's ketone index.

693
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:42,920
Chaffee: I think that's your sort of your your hallmark here. So normally I don't think that you need to

694
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:48,080
fast for any periods of time, you know, apart from just what your body's telling you to do

695
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:53,900
on a carnivore diet. There's there's two schools of thoughts in the ketogenic metabolic therapy

696
01:08:53,900 --> 01:09:01,540
approach to to cancer with carnivore diet. You need to keep your GKI down. There are a lot of

697
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:09,620
Chaffee: studies in animals and humans that show that restricting eating. So not eating as much as your

698
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:18,900
Chaffee: body's necessarily demanding and and having your blood sugar lower and your ketones higher.

699
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,080
Chaffee: And you should that ratio is it called GKI, glucose ketone index. You keep that under two.

700
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,560
Chaffee: That's a therapeutic range. You keep that under one. That's even better.

701
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:34,780
That that has shown to be very beneficial for cancer outcomes and survival and prolonging survival.

702
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:40,740
At least in the the studies that we have so far in GBM, which are limited. And with a lot of

703
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:45,600
studies and a lot of different cancers, but specifically GBM, it's a bit limited. There are smaller

704
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,240
trials anywhere from 15 to 30 people. There is a randomized control trial with about 20 patients

705
01:09:51,240 --> 01:10:00,260
and they have shown efficacy and benefit certainly certainly being safe and in some of these

706
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:06,920
Chaffee: showing benefit people living far past where they would have otherwise actually showing

707
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:13,440
Chaffee: recession and receding GBM even on like fourth line treatment. But they go through the surgery,

708
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:19,280
Chaffee: chemo radiation, it recurs and they have the surgery, some more chemo, last bit of radiation.

709
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:25,420
Chaffee: Now it's not safe and they have a recurrence, they have a re-resection, a re-re-resection. And they

710
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:29,420
Chaffee: can't really, they're sort of capped out on radiation and then they have to go through like

711
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:38,160
Chaffee: you know, different sorts of end stage chemo such as a vastin, which is really hard on the

712
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:43,020
body, makes a brain very friable. It's it for surgeries after that. You can't operate on on a

713
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:47,860
patient's brain after they've been on a vastin because the tissue just falls apart and they just

714
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:54,020
bleed and bleed and bleed and bleed and you can't stop it. So that's sort of a last line approach

715
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:58,420
and then they people have a vastin and they're they're not going they're not being helped and they

716
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:04,340
say well you know you could just stop eating carbs or you could you know and then they

717
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:09,720
Chaffee: they do that. So c-design line does that in America right now and they published a large case

718
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:16,840
Chaffee: series without 15 patients. Most of them were brain tumors not all of them were GBMs but they

719
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:23,300
showed that the brain tumors and the GBMs even responded extremely well even though this was

720
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:30,700
a fourth line defense against against the GBM in that case series they survived for years and

721
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:35,300
Chaffee: years passed where where they were they were they were dying they were on their way out and then they

722
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:42,640
Chaffee: went on keep on a on a ketogenic metabolic therapy and all of a sudden they just kept going

723
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:51,600
and on MRI tumors were shrinking and there's multiple case series with your 15 16 patients

724
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:56,700
there's another case series published out of Phoenix showed the same thing you showed these

725
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:04,180
like big tumors and they're just shrinking down so you know you do a ketogenic carnivore diet

726
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:12,060
and you and you get your GKI down below two from much of the time below one if you can you do

727
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:18,320
that with a combination of ketogenic carnivore diet and fasting if you need it. If you need to have

728
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:25,360
Chaffee: periods of fasting you go for it to bring that that GKI down and then there are you have to

729
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,680
Chaffee: refeed on other days because you don't want to lose too much weight you know this is good you can't

730
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:36,280
let it you know make it so you're too weak to defend yourself and to maintain your body

731
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:47,120
after about eight to well so GBM in particular is a bit nasty because cancer is run on glucose

732
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:55,320
Chaffee: and glutamine and GBM's run on about 75% glutamine and so it they do much better if you get

733
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:01,780
Chaffee: an onto an agent that disrupts glutamine there are chemotherapy agents one is called Don DON I don't

734
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:08,460
have the chemical name a mind at the set at the moment but that's been used in animal models with

735
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:13,360
GBM when you put people like ketogenic diet and Don they they all the mice survived and I was

736
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,660
with the work of Professor Thomas C. free out of Austin College and and they showed that on imaging

737
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:28,940
Chaffee: and then on bio or on histology when they sacrificed the rats that the tumors just died they just

738
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:32,800
Chaffee: gone away and just died cells and just died because you you've taken away their energy sources

739
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:40,060
Chaffee: and they just shut down and died so that may or may not be something that your doctor can help you

740
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:46,440
Chaffee: with that may or may not be something you can get your hands on because of depending on how your

741
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,860
your doctor and your oncologist feels about those sorts of agents but there are chemotherapy

742
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:56,500
agents that do that like Don DON is like chemotherapy agent but it's not necessarily life

743
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:02,160
is for GBM so it would be off label and you don't know if your oncologist would be okay with that

744
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:09,700
um when you fast between eight and fourteen days you make glue to mean first of all you also make

745
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:15,640
Chaffee: glue coes but you're just keeping it down at lower levels and because these cancer cells have

746
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:21,140
Chaffee: such a high metabolic demand and they're inefficient at making energy they really require a lot of

747
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:28,680
Chaffee: this stuff and they don't have a sufficient amount the cells die off and so that's what you want to

748
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:34,060
Chaffee: just want to start these suckers out glue to mean is in meat it's also in plant proteins you're

749
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:41,320
not going to avoid it by you know going vegan or anything like that um glue to mean is denatured

750
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,760
by cooking so if you're really that worried about it you can cook your meat or you can limit your meat

751
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:53,620
and you can have periods of fasting now we'll get rid of incoming glucose and incoming glue to me

752
01:14:54,740 --> 01:15:03,540
and um then you want to if you need to if you need to fast to get your GKI down that can be a

753
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:09,460
helpful adjunct there are people that that you know finds success in this and according to

754
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:16,700
Chaffee: Dr. C Fried when you get to about sort of eight to fourteen day fasting range this actually can

755
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:23,500
can disrupt your your own glue to mean metabolism and so that can actually have favorable results

756
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:28,100
for a long a sort of longer fast and you have to do that carefully to do that under medical

757
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:32,820
Chaffee: supervision to be careful about refeeding and how you start eating again after you have to

758
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:37,660
you do a long fast like that where else you can you can hurt yourself but those are some things

759
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:44,680
Chaffee: that people are currently trialing and and using in their in their own

760
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,740
cases or in their patient populations for different people that are treating this sort of thing

761
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:54,940
Chaffee: and then the other side of it is the paleo metacena side and they've been treating cancer's

762
01:15:54,940 --> 01:16:02,540
Chaffee: in GBMs for 15 years with this with a pkd diet of the paleolithic ketogenic diet which is

763
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:09,580
what gave memory eating during the ice ages which is meat that's it right so there there was

764
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:15,700
absolutely nothing besides fatty meat but you limit the amount that you're eating and so you

765
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,800
Chaffee: have to use organs so you eat organs because they're more nutrient dense you're not getting in as

766
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:25,380
Chaffee: much food so you need more nutrient dense food and so you're limiting the amount that you're eating

767
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:34,000
all the studies show in animals and humans that restricted you know calorie restricted I hate that

768
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,320
but calorie restricted eating calorie restricted ketogenic diets are are the most beneficial

769
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:45,560
to survival and longevity and improved outcomes so that's something that's what they do so they don't

770
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,920
Chaffee: do fasting they don't want you to do fasting but they definitely do restrict so you're restricting

771
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:56,080
Chaffee: what you're taking in you're eating more high density food and nutrition and and you're a very,

772
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,660
Chaffee: very dull than with that so those are those are some caveats but really what you do you do

773
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:07,940
Chaffee: exactly same thing you very high fat and I mean like two grams of fat to one gram of protein and

774
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:14,380
you really get your your key tones up and you try to keep your GKI down below two and below one

775
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:18,440
as much as possible on average for the week and that's what you have different days you might be

776
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:24,060
fasting you may need to fast you may need to limit what you eat and to get your GKI down but that's

777
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:29,820
what I would do and I would adjust what your eat I would still eat the same thing fatty meat and some

778
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:37,520
organs but I would do it in such a way that you can keep your GKI down most of the time and if you

779
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:44,500
have to limit what you're eating or fast for periods of time and you're losing more weight than

780
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:49,480
than you should you're going to have to have refeed days you're going to have to you know feed the

781
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:55,540
body and make sure you're getting enough nutrition for your body so you can support yourself in this

782
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:59,100
and then you should have these periods of refeed days and then you go back to it all right

783
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:04,780
your body can do that you know we're more than capable and adapted to deal with

784
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:09,520
famines and lean times and so your body can do that you just be very careful with it make sure

785
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,800
you're not losing too much weight so that it affects your health negatively and you have these

786
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:19,420
refeed days but you have these these stretches in these periods where you are significantly

787
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:25,520
limiting the amount of available energy for these cancer cells and if you can hit it with

788
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,430
something like dawn or some of these other agents that disrupt glue to me that you can you can

789
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:39,160
look into there's a lot of you know literature on that and that's something that is

790
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:44,800
is in keeping you know safe for you to do with your current plan you know obviously you need to

791
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:55,500
talk to your doctor about these sorts of things you know then you do that that's that's

792
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,680
Chaffee: ketogenic diet and every now and then you hit it with like strong words like you're just going to

793
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:04,120
Chaffee: fast for a week and you're going to hit it with dawn and you're going to do these sorts of things

794
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:08,960
where you really aggressively go at it so it's constant pressure of just energy depth it's constant

795
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,960
energy deprivation for these cancer cells and then every now and then you hit it with you know

796
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:20,660
these periods of fasting and and you know the glue to me disruptors and then the other

797
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:28,180
you know flying the ointment there is dootarium which is this is seems to be a very interesting

798
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:33,240
line of research that's now growing but there's a guy named Dr. Gavor Somlai who's actually

799
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:39,720
Chaffee: published multiple papers on this and how having lower amounts of dootarium in the body which is

800
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:45,740
Chaffee: heavy hydrogens is hydrogen with an extra neutron on it or with a neutron added onto it that this

801
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:51,660
actually can be very damaging to the mitochondria damaging to the cells and if you have lower

802
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:57,520
levels of dootarium this can actually disrupt and damage cancer cells more and can actually help

803
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:04,560
in that treatment also which is how he came to ketogenic carnivores or diets because that's the

804
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:10,580
diet that naturally lowers your dootarium more than anything else so I have a couple of interviews

805
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:15,780
with him on my channel and I have another interview with Dr. Lazlo Boros on the subject and he's

806
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:22,880
Chaffee: you know a professor of medicine at UCLA and ran a biochemistry lab there and did a lot of research

807
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:28,440
Chaffee: on dootarium and he actually didn't believe that either side was crazy and Gavor found him they're

808
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:33,840
both from Hungary originally but hey once you do this research and he's like oh my god this is crazy

809
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,560
and he's just like all right well look it's $25,000 a cell line if you want to do something like that

810
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:45,260
yeah let's do three okay these guys are serious so we ran the test and he went holy shit these

811
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:50,660
guys run this something like this is this is actually real and so now he just went full on head

812
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:56,880
long into the research and now he teaches that he teaches deutonomics which is a deuterium based

813
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:03,420
biochemistry and how this affects diseases so that's another thing you can sort of look into probably

814
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:08,900
too long of a topic to get into here but you know if you look up those interviews

815
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:16,280
with Lazlo Boros and Gavor some like on my channel I just did a more recent one it has more new

816
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:21,540
published data showing the benefits of this so something to think about you know if I had something

817
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:26,960
like GBM or family member did I would just throw the kitchen sink at it and I would just be extremely

818
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:34,360
Chaffee: aggressive with this stuff because GBMs don't mess around they are likely one of the most aggressive

819
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:40,340
Chaffee: cancers that exist certainly the most aggressive primary brain tumor and so it's it's not something

820
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:49,340
you want to play around with I would be exquisitely strict if I had something like this and I would

821
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:56,080
just be borderline neurotic about my numbers and making sure that everything was just

822
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:02,260
exactly the way I wanted it at least at first until you got into a pattern you figured out how you could

823
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:08,020
Chaffee: you know how you could live with this sort of thing and and even down the road if you're seeing

824
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:12,420
Chaffee: like hey there's nothing here there's nothing here my MRIs are all clean you know it can all

825
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,980
it could spark back up you know it's that you have to be you have to take this very seriously this

826
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:23,940
is a they life long issue and so even while there are long-term survivors you know nine

827
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:28,300
Chaffee: years plus that have been doing this and there's others that I've been talking people I'm

828
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:33,020
Chaffee: talking to they're like oh yeah there's this random guy been 23 years doing ketogenic diet with

829
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:37,440
Chaffee: the GBM and just but just no one knows who the hell he is he's just he's just off living his life you

830
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:45,180
know and so I'm still trying to track that guy down but you know when you start slipping off of this

831
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:51,360
this can come back you know uh uh uh friend of mine Pablo Kelly is one of these long-term survivors

832
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:58,760
with GBM and he had a bit of a relapse because he started saying well I should be able to have

833
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:04,260
Chaffee: ice cream with my kids I should be able to eat this and I should be able to do that and always

834
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:09,020
Chaffee: starting to have a more symptoms and I went in and got checked out and I'll ship this things growing

835
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:15,880
again and so it just realizing no I can't think like that that's stupid I should be able to should

836
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:23,500
doesn't come into it I can't and so if I want to be here for my kids and my wife I can't and so he's

837
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:29,120
now back on back on the straight and narrow so um that's that's where you have to think of too

838
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:35,100
Chaffee: is that this isn't this GBM isn't necessarily something that's gonna go away and stay away

839
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:40,080
it's something that that if it goes away you have to keep it away by doing this so this is a

840
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:47,720
time commitment this is a a lifestyle this is just this is just how you live your life now it's

841
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:52,820
no different than any you know than any three of us here and how we're living our life as well

842
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:59,340
Chaffee: it's just you need to be just you know very switched on and you know there's less room for error

843
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:04,260
Chaffee: you know you can't have these cheat days oh well whatever I mean you can but it's going to be detrimental

844
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:12,240
and so you know that's what I would do I would just be very very dialed in and strict with it

845
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:16,020
yeah and I think that that's a download just to when people talk about type two diabetes for

846
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:20,280
instance and we talk about reversing it and I get in online arguments where they say we've not

847
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:25,380
cured it I'll say no you've reversed the symptoms if they go back to the wrong way of eating

848
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:30,680
then you you're opening the door back to those symptoms so it's sort of very similar to that obviously

849
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:37,740
more dramatic brilliant answer there I think it's Daiso Oxo Norl Lucy and if people want to

850
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:41,540
look it up when it's six at the beginning and five in the middle of that so anyway I did

851
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:46,740
hold still in the comments at earlier I was it yeah it isn't comments yeah

852
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:52,420
Norl Norl thank you very much for nine nine nine nine that's of course I think I've done

853
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:57,580
where that super chat's gone to but thank you very much very generous super chat I think this

854
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:06,840
to doctrine to the chafee for $100 is meat of the young calf not veal nutritionally okay to have

855
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:14,160
Chaffee: as a mature beef meat it's the meat of the calf what nutritionally okay yeah well so it's

856
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:20,940
Chaffee: like an Australia you know it's like they they it's basically just just the next step past the

857
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:27,620
old it'd be like yearlings you know so like in America it's usually like 18 months to to 24 months

858
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:33,460
they would get they would slaughter the steers but in Australia they do a lot of yearlings

859
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:38,060
Chaffee: which we're the bugs maybe because they're like smaller stakes and like where the hell's my big

860
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:45,560
Chaffee: ass robot like and you know it's a smaller so I look I think it's I think it's very similar

861
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:54,300
but you know it's something that that I would like to do some some test with or talk to some

862
01:25:54,300 --> 01:26:00,020
some ranchers about doing some tests the thing is is that we don't I think when you when you

863
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:05,540
have an animal out just eating grass it's sort of building up you know nutrient density and you can

864
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:10,160
taste that in the meat I've had different age meat and it just tastes more beef you just more beef

865
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:15,540
flavor those flavors are the nutrients and then you have these sort of very bland sort of

866
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:21,860
am I really getting anything out of this um so you know you have these regenerally raised grass

867
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:25,980
Chaffee: fed and finished cows and it's just like there's much more flavor to it there's much more of this

868
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:32,940
Chaffee: nice rich sort of there's actually an aroma that's very different on grass fed meat and

869
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:39,480
especially older ones and and and you know it the taste is different it's just it's much more

870
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:48,060
potent it's not gaming but it's just more beef flavor if that makes sense and um and we can see

871
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:53,000
Chaffee: in regenerally raised grass fed and finished cows in any case that at least some of the ranchers

872
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,760
Chaffee: that I've spoken to that they've sent their meat off and got it tested and it's like four or five

873
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:01,440
times a number of micro nutrients so you know it does objectively have more nutrients in there and

874
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:09,440
I think that probably is reflected in the taste from similar age cows now I've had older

875
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,600
cows I've grass fed their entire life I would imagine that they have more nutrient density because

876
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:22,740
Chaffee: they have 10 times a beef flavor of even these these other younger regenerally raised grass fed

877
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:28,220
and finished cows they don't they aren't commercially viable at the moment probably that's

878
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:32,400
good for all of us who know about this because they're way better and you can generally get them

879
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:38,560
Chaffee: for cheaper and you don't have to fight for them but they're freaking delicious and so if you can

880
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:44,360
Chaffee: go to a rancher and just say hey I want your oldest cow that's only ever eaten grass generally

881
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:49,180
they they they just grind them up for hamburger because we were like oh they're too tough I think

882
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:56,200
you're sacrificing um flavor for texture and the texture is not all that different it's actually

883
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:01,140
excellent the gristle is as hard as almost like gets me tendons are like whale bone it's just like

884
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:06,000
oh god but they're usually just to pluck out and just toss them you're not chewing on them and

885
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,740
you know it's like meat gum for two hours you know you just do just chuck it you get rid of it

886
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:16,640
Chaffee: and so I would imagine that those are more nutrient dense the older that you get if it's eating

887
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:21,200
if it's eating a better die however I don't know anyone who sent that off because they're they're

888
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:26,760
they're not I don't know people that haven't older heard they're selling that to a bespoke market

889
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:31,160
and they're sending this off say oh look at this we have 10 times 20 times the amount of nutrients

890
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:36,540
I think if you're eating younger younger meat it's not going to be as nutrient dense it's still

891
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:42,480
going to be fantastic it's still going to be absolutely you know you know hands down better than

892
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:48,120
then the other options available certainly the other plant based options available and so

893
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:53,220
Chaffee: if that's what you have available that's what you have that's available to you I think that's fine and

894
01:28:53,720 --> 01:29:00,640
you know but I would expect that if we were to test older older cows that you get more nutrient

895
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:08,240
density out of it yes great great this is a really nice question from Tom Dr. Chafi could you

896
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:15,460
clarify what you mean by carnival being a fasting mimicking diet in my opinion after you eat a

897
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:22,880
kilo of meat you're definitely not in a fasting state no I 100% agree with you and

898
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:30,140
it's it's not a fasting mimicking diet a fasting mimics a carnivore diet fasting mimics

899
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:38,160
your our our primary metabolic state the metabolic state that we are in when we eat our our

900
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:44,200
Chaffee: main source of nutrition which is meat it hasn't always been meat since the dawn of humanity

901
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:49,600
so yeah when you eat a kilo of meat you are definitely not fasting and so that's the thing these

902
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:55,800
these were this was misnamed a fasting metabolism and a fed metabolism and that goes back decades

903
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,600
and I think the only reason we did that was because by the time we were able to look at our

904
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:05,140
biochemistry at a molecular level everyone was eating carbohydrates and I said oh when you eat it

905
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:10,560
looks like this and when you don't eat it looks they're completely different failing to recognize

906
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,940
that if anything else except carbohydrates it also looks like you you aren't eating at all speaking

907
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:23,280
my niece who's now you know pre-med in America and she's taking biochemistry this year or

908
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:28,620
maybe she's even yeah she's taking it this year she was saying they don't they don't even call it

909
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:34,680
fed-say and fasting state anymore it's a carbohydrate metabolism and a non carbohydrate metabolism

910
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:40,720
which is much more accurate you know that the fed-say and the fasting state that's a you know

911
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:46,640
you know that's a value judgment you know just save it like all this is the only thing we're

912
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:52,740
Chaffee: eating over here so yeah it is just a carbohydrate metabolism versus a non carbohydrate metabolism

913
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:58,040
and I think that the non carbohydrate metabolism is our primary metabolic state and that

914
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:04,900
fasting mimics it I think that a lot of the benefit you get from fasting largely comes from just

915
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:09,260
not eating the wrong thing and from being in the correct metabolic state you know this is something

916
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:14,280
Chaffee: with insulin insulin has you know over a hundred different mechanisms in the body one of them

917
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:21,120
Chaffee: is to suppress and decrease a top of G and the turnover that organelles in the cells that are older

918
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:26,260
Chaffee: and damage so it's when people talk all you have to fast for five days every now and then

919
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:30,960
Chaffee: and all that sort of stuff to get the all top of G you only have to get 72 hours and 84 hours so

920
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,700
116 hours all that sort of stuff no you just don't you just need to stop eating carbohydrates you

921
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:41,360
need your insulin down that happens all the time so at the moment I believe that Steven

922
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:48,420
Richard and myself have been on the equivalent of you know six thousand four hundred and eighty

923
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:53,340
two day fast you know because we just we just our insulin has been low this whole time

924
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:59,280
Chaffee: obviously not that long but you know a long ass time it's certainly longer than 72 hours so

925
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:06,680
the top of G has been long accounted for in our in our systems so it's really just comes

926
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:12,920
down to being the correct metabolic state 70% of all animal species are carnivores they're all eating

927
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:20,500
protein if that they're all in this so-called ketogenic starvation state right and animals that eat

928
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:27,220
Chaffee: fiber break down that fiber into saturated fat and protein so they're not getting carbohydrates either

929
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:32,340
Chaffee: they're in the non-carbohydrate driven metabolism also so this isn't a shock to your system

930
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:38,160
Chaffee: this is out care what rape heat tells you in your nightmares like it's just it's not the case

931
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:43,160
Chaffee: that this is shock to the system or stress to the system this is the normal metabolic state

932
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:50,420
of human beings and nearly every animal on earth and so the idea that this is stressing us and

933
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:56,440
freaking us out and this is bad makes absolutely no sense biologically and is wrong anyway

934
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:05,240
people can look at Richard and I's I appreciate my video on the subject here is ketosis harmful

935
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:13,420
short answer no and we go through like just hours of data and literature on that and to really

936
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:19,100
sort of hammer that point home brilliant Anthony thank you so much for your time

937
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:25,020
Richard just private message me and I didn't realize we'd show over an hour but quite considerable

938
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:29,900
testing so I've been trying to sort of exaggerate with questions but I'm going to say two hours

939
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:36,700
just fine yeah you're right to hours yeah yeah yeah oh fantastic yeah if I'll keep my trap

940
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:43,920
that then I was just continue yeah well I know that's all good yeah I thought it was two hours

941
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:52,240
but then you know Richard's on who you know so it's good can I just jump if we're staying on can I just

942
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:57,060
jump into ad to that as well so that yeah I agree completely what Anthony's just said it's

943
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,940
just by being in a ketogenic state which is what we are in this is our metabolic state even

944
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:08,380
when we live in a carnival lifestyle the benefits that we see of fast in which are autopsy

945
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:15,060
autopsy mightophyg brown fat activation lipolysis and insulin sensitivity there are all exhibited

946
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:20,660
to live in the lifestyle regardless of whether we are in a state of a m pk or m to activation

947
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:26,540
we are benefit it it's like a sea sort of fact one predominance with both are always playing that

948
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:33,940
fact but it those benefits are there regardless of being fasted or not and this is why you

949
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:39,920
just live in the lifestyle as that benefit and we don't need to force fast in and I would also

950
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:44,820
argue that maybe potentially extended fast in doesn't benefit a lot of a lot of women

951
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:52,980
the more that I'm working with I'm seem to see that then being in more of I don't want to use

952
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:59,120
the term fed state after Anthony's just said that but maybe he did two to three meals a day

953
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:04,660
may help a little bit better in regards to but some people do thrive but it does cause

954
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:11,200
homeowner shoes who some and what I would argue is that if we look at our our evolutionary period

955
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:17,560
the men of the tribe would be out hunting in for hours and days well the females were

956
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:22,840
were there prepping food or maybe eating before the hunt has returned and therefore

957
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:29,880
their state of prolonged fasting was going to be a lot lower than that of the men and this is

958
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:34,440
seems to be a big big problem within the female community that I work with that they're pushing

959
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:42,020
for the extended fast and it leads to lethargy skin conditions hair loss and it's to do with

960
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:46,000
not eating enough and we're told by many of the influences in the community that is because of

961
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:52,620
lack of carbohydrate to create thyroid hormone but it's not to do with carbohydrates it's to do with

962
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:59,300
not eating enough and that comes down to animal proteins and fat we need animal proteins and we need

963
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:05,040
fat especially for the production of hormones so don't neglect the nutrition eat when you

964
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:09,160
hungry you know if you're not hungry don't eat but be mindful that we do need that protein

965
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:15,900
we do need that fat and the benefits are there regardless of fasting or not. Yeah I'm still struggling

966
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:23,900
to see what part of carbohydrates help us make thyroid hormone but anyway so here's a nice question

967
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:33,160
why blood pressure went down significantly going from coffee to de-caf coffee any benefits to

968
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:40,040
Chaffee: quitting the de-caf and I did worthy of quitting. Well I mean that's that's interesting your blood pressure

969
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:44,900
Chaffee: went down I wonder what type of de-caf you switch to you know there are things called

970
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:52,120
Chaffee: rancid oils in coffee that when you heat it over 160 degrees they come out and on our known to

971
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:59,000
kickoff hypertension and so generally like filters like filter coffee will actually take that out so

972
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:05,340
things like the spressos or like the bottom press coffee those are the French press coffees they

973
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:09,360
won't filter that out and you sort of see this oily sort of sheen on the surface and those

974
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:14,760
can definitely jack up your blood pressure and this is what cold brew coffee was for us will

975
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:20,900
be the the heart healthy blood pressure coffee back in the 60s and 70s and things like that

976
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:28,360
sort of had a resurgence in with Starbucks and things like that more recently but I would wonder what

977
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:33,580
what you're switching to you know caffeine can certainly affect that but it's generally the generally

978
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:39,200
things that affect your blood pressure the most or those rancid oils so I I wonder if you

979
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:43,700
went to this sort of de-caf is now filtered as opposed to more of spressos sort of things from coffee

980
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:54,260
Chaffee: I don't know but as to benefits from drop dropping decaf absolutely so caffeine is just one of

981
01:37:54,260 --> 01:38:00,580
Chaffee: 150,000 or so chemicals that are in coffee and there's all sorts of these different nasty chemicals

982
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:06,020
Chaffee: that are not good for you when you when you taste something bitter your brain is warning you about

983
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:10,380
Chaffee: something saying hey why don't you not eat this you know we used out there just putting things in your

984
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:14,160
mouth and you're like oh that tastes good I'll eat it that tastes better no I'm not going to eat it

985
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:20,360
that's the natural instinct in nature until you have someone telling you no that bitter taste is good

986
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:24,580
oh that's good yes you wanted to taste horrible you want to hate your life you know like well

987
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:30,600
that doesn't make sense you know but we we convince ourselves of this so if you have that bitter taste

988
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:35,560
your brains your brains telling you there's something there that you don't want so coffee's very bitter

989
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:41,420
Chaffee: and you know it's it's a being being as a seed as he's a plant's baby that's where you

990
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:45,220
generally find the highest concentration of toxins is in the seeds which because the plant's

991
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:49,820
trying to protect that most because that's the next generation so yes I think there's absolutely

992
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:56,660
Chaffee: a lot of benefit to dropping decaf in fact I generally the rather see people like switch to caffeine

993
01:38:56,660 --> 01:39:05,100
pills and and and skip the whole decaf side of the coffee that the caffeine although it's a

994
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:10,520
neurotoxin developed as an insecticide to fry the brains of insects that are trying to eat that

995
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:18,160
plant I still think that getting rid of those 150,000 other things probably even more beneficial

996
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:23,300
than just getting rid of the caffeine if you take a caffeine pill in the morning and that can

997
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:27,100
Chaffee: give you the bump that you want then you can sort of do that and then when you're so far off that

998
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:30,660
Chaffee: and come off eventually you'll have better energy anyway but you'll you'll have less you know

999
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:36,100
Chaffee: hornets and aches and muscle pains and joint pains and other sorts of problems but um you're

1000
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:39,920
already off the caffeine so don't worry about that don't start the caffeine pill now because you're

1001
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,720
already off the caffeine I would just drop it completely and just switch back switch over to water

1002
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:48,700
I think you'll feel a lot better overall and have a lot less information in your body

1003
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:57,400
great okay we've got Lucy here who's been kind of off for seven months but she's having

1004
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:04,660
gut issues blood tests are all clear try lyandia but end up at the toilet between two to three hours

1005
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:16,850
of eating any suggestions for helping my gut microbiome well the thing is is that it well it

1006
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:22,430
could be your microbiome but you do you have to always consider all the other things you know are

1007
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:27,170
Chaffee: are you strict lyandizers strict meat and water do you still have any sort of artificial

1008
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:33,170
Chaffee: sweeteners you have even electrolytes that have stevia or or a leprethar tall things like that

1009
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:38,290
Chaffee: are you having coffee are you having tea do you take magnesium supplements do you take met

1010
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:43,830
Chaffee: foreman or other sorts of diabetes medications these can all cause loose stools or at least

1011
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:47,410
you know have mild laxative effects and now you don't have much of fiber in your body they can move

1012
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:52,790
things through more quickly and then obviously if your your body has a limited capacity to absorb

1013
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:59,990
fat and so if you're eating far past your body's capacity to absorb fat it's going to go out and

1014
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:08,470
has to come out just one way one direction so that is um that is something that can cause

1015
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:15,010
Chaffee: loose stools as well so you know especially we're talking about the timing of your of your meals

1016
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:19,870
Chaffee: there you're eating a lyandia you're just eating meat and then you're like oh nope this has to go

1017
01:41:19,870 --> 01:41:25,510
that could suggest that maybe you're ingesting something that's being this long if you're having

1018
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:30,990
anything else if you're not as assume you're not that's about the time you'd see that this is

1019
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:35,910
sort of coming through your system and digestion and the fat that didn't get digested and it was

1020
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:41,390
or is now coming out and causing problems it's not necessarily a problem it's not necessarily

1021
01:41:41,390 --> 01:41:48,790
that your sick or there's an issue it's just inconvenient and so that could be an issue as well

1022
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:56,130
so just maybe look at that and see if you can adjust your fat and if that changes anything if you can

1023
01:41:56,130 --> 01:42:01,470
Chaffee: if you're very very constipated and you get overflow diarrhea where you have blocked up and you

1024
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:06,830
Chaffee: can get liquid stools pushing around the harder stools and get liquid diarrhea pretty much all the

1025
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:10,990
Chaffee: time and then every now and then you get like this boulder that comes out this sounds more like the

1026
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:15,890
other side that you're having more fat you eat that fat your body just can't absorb it all so it

1027
01:42:15,890 --> 01:42:22,230
Chaffee: just goes out especially people with without a gallbladder may run into that as well because

1028
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:27,490
Chaffee: they're just not going to be able to absorb as much fat in one go so maybe play with that if you

1029
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:31,110
try these sorts of things you've eliminated out everything else you've played around with the fat

1030
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:38,150
levels and you do still think this is a microbiome issue seven months carnivore though it's

1031
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:45,870
most people's microbiomes are radically different at that point but all things if you

1032
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:50,250
Chaffee: exclude everything else and you need and you're thinking maybe this is a microbiome issue

1033
01:42:50,910 --> 01:42:57,590
fermented yogurt so fermented dairy you get that live culture yogurt small amounts no carbs

1034
01:42:57,590 --> 01:43:02,730
if you can some of them have a little bit but try to get like the the lowest carbs you can put

1035
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:07,790
that on a piece of meat chew it up together swallow it together whole you can work those bacteria

1036
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:14,870
sort of into the bowl of some food and that will hopefully get it past your stomach acid and

1037
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:22,190
burn top and get it off down into your into your colon and you just do that for a week or two

1038
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:28,250
but that should recede your bacteria and then just the food that you're eating will support the

1039
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:32,750
bacteria but you know if you think it's a microbiome issue you can always send off for a microbiome

1040
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:37,770
test seven months on a carnivore diet most people actually have pretty stellar microbiomes at that

1041
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:43,950
point so I would from what you're telling me there it seems sounds more like excess fat to me but

1042
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:51,690
maybe you guys have a thought on that yeah I agree yeah I think minced meat minced beef can

1043
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:57,270
cause an issue again it's the fat issue it's got to be predominantly a fat problem especially

1044
01:43:57,270 --> 01:44:02,210
with that sort of movement time the quality of meat I would question whether you're consuming

1045
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:08,110
aged meats because aged meats obviously by definition become rancid so eat you eat fresh

1046
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:13,410
you know if you do buy in bulk freeze it as soon as you can and try to eat it

1047
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:19,310
you know as you're taking it out of the freezer but fresh is always best but minced meat I've

1048
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:24,690
I've noticed as caused a number of issues with clients of mine I'm a big fan of minced meat

1049
01:44:24,690 --> 01:44:30,530
this incredibly cheap incredibly new drink dense I love pan fry in it and I'll pour the fat over

1050
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:34,830
and I think this incredible sometimes I'll fry an egg and check that on top as well but

1051
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:40,070
it does cause issues with some people so I think honestly he's hit the nail on the head I think it's

1052
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:47,990
Chaffee: predominantly a fat issue and I'm sorry oh I'm just gonna say too and that rendered fat seems

1053
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:54,390
Chaffee: to be go through people quicker yeah so yeah so then when you're doing like ground beef just

1054
01:44:54,390 --> 01:45:00,170
Chaffee: like Richard said a lot of that will render out and and that can be it just it just goes through

1055
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:05,950
quicker more quickly if you have it like the solid fat tissue and you chew it up obviously and

1056
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:10,190
but then your your body has to sort of work on these things with your asses and digest events

1057
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:15,130
on takes longer to extract that fat gives your body a chance to respond with life pace and

1058
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:22,590
bile to get out there and actually break the stuff down and absorb it so it's more conducive

1059
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:29,010
to adequate digestion and absorption and so what some people find even when they're lowering

1060
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:32,430
Chaffee: down the amount of fat and they're still having issues with it or the earlier there's still

1061
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:37,450
Chaffee: you a very reasonable amount of low amount of fat and none of these other issues that we touched on

1062
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:46,070
Chaffee: that when they start eating solid fat as most rendered fat or they even I the most extreme

1063
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:51,010
Chaffee: I've seen people have to do is they cut off the fat before cooking and eat it uncooked and then

1064
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:55,330
cooked the rest of the meat separately and that that seemed to work for a number of people

1065
01:45:56,670 --> 01:46:04,650
one one thing that I've seen as a growing trend is that people think that they have to just

1066
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:11,850
take on so much salt that they actually dump a ton of salt and rock salt in their in their

1067
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:16,210
water so it's just I mean they're just drinking like you know water from the dead sea or something

1068
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:22,610
like that and it's just like it's just a ton of salt that isn't osmotic that work as an osmotic

1069
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:29,510
laxated that pull out water from your body and just flush your bowel so if you want to do a bowel

1070
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:35,550
flush that's how you do it um I don't recommend it but um but that was that was one thing

1071
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:40,270
Chaffee: I was I was talking to uh I thought you want to multiple people you're talking about what are you

1072
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:44,910
Chaffee: eating what are you doing this this and this and it sounded like the only thing they were doing

1073
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:50,370
was meat and water and then it was just sort of at the animals like oh well I'm also putting in a

1074
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:56,330
lot lot of salt into my water and it's just like okay well that can absolutely do it so just

1075
01:46:56,330 --> 01:47:02,070
just try to think of all these things as well and uh but those are some some points that can help

1076
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:07,590
and what fats are you cooking and also uh I don't cook in any fat anymore I just use the fat

1077
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:12,910
from the meat that I cook in but I know within our community um you know we're heavily biased towards

1078
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:18,670
adding uh butter, tallow, lard, or ghee but you don't need to add any fat when cooking um

1079
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:23,010
possibly another lever to polarity take a fat when cooking out if you are using salt.

1080
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:29,630
Cool that's great um just for those that are wondering why I'm not answering many questions

1081
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:35,990
it's because later on if you want to ask questions of myself or Richard we have our live

1082
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:42,110
Chaffee: in five hours times seven p.m. in the UK we do another hour and a half an hour on YouTube and then

1083
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:49,730
30 minutes on another platform which rhymes with apple crumble so um yes you can check us out there

1084
01:47:49,730 --> 01:47:55,590
Lucy from England by the way Richard's from Wales you know so I'm in England he's he's

1085
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:59,830
he's in Wales that's the United Kingdom anyway uh or if you're from England and you're looking

1086
01:47:59,830 --> 01:48:05,570
for beef jerky I have found this if you really go from the guy that does the mason survival

1087
01:48:05,570 --> 01:48:11,470
protocol because we we always get all these Americans we've all these fantastic things and uh

1088
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:24,470
okay we've like behind oh sorry really it's yeah it's crazy yeah it's crazy but like we're going

1089
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:29,630
to grow the kind of movement away from America and everywhere else so hello from England I have

1090
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:35,510
a question if we cannot take into much fact due to our bodies only taking what we need

1091
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:43,910
how does PSMF which is protein sparing modified fasting work so well for people just curious

1092
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:49,930
Chaffee: that's struggling with white oh look you can starve yourself and you're smaller dress size

1093
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:53,630
Chaffee: everybody knows that but it doesn't mean that it's it's the most beneficial thing for your body

1094
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:58,370
Chaffee: doesn't mean it's the healthiest thing it doesn't mean it's the thing that uh is going to be conducive

1095
01:48:58,370 --> 01:49:05,410
Chaffee: to a a healthy strong metabolism there's the the um the Minnesota starvation trial that

1096
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:13,310
doesn't in world war two they show that you put people on just basically you know um concentration

1097
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:19,890
camera actions and yeah you'll lose weight to a two a point and then it'll level off and it'll

1098
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:25,750
plateau and um and then and then that that slows down and just sort of is able to maintain on extremely

1099
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:34,190
low intake uh that's your metabolism is slowing down and so you know that's not necessarily what

1100
01:49:34,190 --> 01:49:38,470
you want if it was just calories and calories out then uh some of these people would would have

1101
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:42,570
ceased to exist because it would have lost they would have had to have lost more weight than they

1102
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:52,690
started with so you know the modified um protein sparing uh fasting um so that's just basically eating

1103
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:58,790
like a keto carnivore diet but just super high protein and like next to no fat and the idea

1104
01:49:58,790 --> 01:50:03,210
there is that well you have you have fat availability body can use that I don't I don't tend to

1105
01:50:03,210 --> 01:50:08,210
agree with that our our body is making bile for a reason I don't think your body does that by mistake

1106
01:50:08,210 --> 01:50:13,050
I don't think that it's just an accident your body is spending a lot of energy and resources

1107
01:50:13,050 --> 01:50:20,070
to make bile to absorb fat that it doesn't even want um I don't I just don't think that that

1108
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:26,510
makes sense at first principle first principles and fundamental physiological paces

1109
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:31,830
Chaffee: bile is expensive is an expensive resource and it costs a lot for our body to make it so you know

1110
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:37,670
it doesn't just do that for no reason and since it's a limited resource I think our body is very

1111
01:50:37,670 --> 01:50:44,230
specific okay we need this amount right your body knows that it has fat there you know and it's saying

1112
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:53,390
hey we want more that isn't just a calorie source that is a set and grouping of essential nutrients

1113
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:57,610
or essential fatty acids you have to have you can get very sick or you can die there essential

1114
01:50:57,610 --> 01:51:02,130
fat soluble nutrients you have to have you can get sick and you can die so this is this is not

1115
01:51:02,130 --> 01:51:07,610
Chaffee: something that you can just say yeah yeah it's fine um do you have all the fat soluble vitamins in

1116
01:51:07,610 --> 01:51:13,550
Chaffee: your adipose tissue do you have all the omega 3s and dHA and EPA just stored there probably not you

1117
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:19,190
know you have you have excess energy stored there it's not necessarily in the form of the fatty

1118
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:26,010
essential fatty acids and fat soluble vitamins that you actually require so I don't really buy

1119
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:31,330
into that and you know if people if people want to do that and they feel that that's helpful to

1120
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:37,830
them and they can but I think that you run the risk of actually lowering your metabolism and just

1121
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:42,390
you go into the zioo diets where you drop your metabolism and you lose weight for a while and

1122
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:46,810
Chaffee: this sort of plateau is off and you sort of feel miserable and you're not really having you know enjoying

1123
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:50,630
Chaffee: this you say okay I'm going to go back to what I was doing before or maybe eating more fat and then

1124
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:55,570
you you balloon up and you put on weight oh my god I think it really scared of eating anyway any other

1125
01:51:55,570 --> 01:51:59,350
Chaffee: way because you put on weight well of course you're putting on weight because you're telling your

1126
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:02,830
Chaffee: body you're in a famine and that you don't have enough nutrients and you're not able to get what

1127
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:09,250
your body requires and so your metabolism has to slow down and as it slowed down it stays down

1128
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:13,190
and then when you start eating more you put on weight because you're by saying nope we need to store

1129
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:19,410
this now the studies with the biggest loser show where they they you know they're just the same thing

1130
01:52:19,410 --> 01:52:24,590
don't need anything to stick a celery a week and then just work your ass off and they just

1131
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:29,710
destroy their meat they lost weight but they destroyed their metabolism and they tested them six years

1132
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:35,950
Chaffee: later their metabolism had never recovered so you know that's not that's not great right so that's

1133
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:39,490
Chaffee: what you want to do if you want to you want to encourage your metabolism you want to encourage your

1134
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:45,990
body and say hey look we're not in a famine whatever you tell me I'm giving it to you right if you're

1135
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:49,150
eating carbs you're eating lectins you're eating others sorts of things in a fear with insulin

1136
01:52:49,150 --> 01:52:54,690
leptin and and and growing you're going to overeat if you're eating just meat that doesn't happen

1137
01:52:54,690 --> 01:52:59,730
and so your body will tell you how much it wants you don't have to micromanage it you don't have to

1138
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:05,010
guess your body will do it for you you just take in what your body is asking you for and I think

1139
01:53:05,010 --> 01:53:12,010
that includes that the other concern and it's a real concern is that if you're just on a

1140
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:20,730
carnivore diet or you know a heavily animal-based ketogenic diet and it's very low that or know

1141
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:26,510
that where your back was coming from it's coming from protein only and when you're only driving

1142
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:32,810
energy from protein that can actually be dangerous and so you get what's called you look it out

1143
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:40,390
called you know like rabbit starvation and protein poisoning and it's not good it's not good for you

1144
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:47,830
you do need you do need to get your energy from other sources aside protein as well

1145
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:53,730
and and that and obviously if you're not eating plants and carbs you're getting that from that

1146
01:53:54,170 --> 01:54:00,510
you could do it from from car but I wouldn't I would I would get it from the vet also if you're

1147
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:06,550
going to lose weight why are you not eating fat you know which it was very calorie dense

1148
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:11,390
oh you already have that okay what are you putting in your mouth you're putting in things and

1149
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:17,390
you put it on a scale it has weight so you're eating things right so if you're going to get the

1150
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:23,850
same amount of calories why wouldn't you eat the calories the 2000 calories at way less

1151
01:54:23,850 --> 01:54:30,390
Chaffee: right one might what do I mean by that that has nine calories per gram and so we think well

1152
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:37,010
Chaffee: guys all that calories and you could store those as fat oh don't eat that right and then there's one

1153
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:45,590
gram per you know of four calories per one gram of carbs and amino acids however when you're

1154
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:53,230
using protein as energy it actually drops down to about 3.4 calories per gram so in real terms

1155
01:54:53,230 --> 01:55:02,370
if you're talking about taking in calories from from meat and you're just eating the protein

1156
01:55:02,370 --> 01:55:06,410
side of things and you're not eating the fat side of things you will have to take in more

1157
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:13,350
grams of meat of protein in order to get the same amount of calories so you have to take in more

1158
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:20,830
Chaffee: weight you will be weighing more right and you know and calories in calorie are really bad

1159
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:25,910
Chaffee: model anyway because most of protein gets used as as building blocks in any case and carbohydrates

1160
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:30,370
Chaffee: affect a lot of hormones and then there's a lot of fatty acids that you used as as building blocks

1161
01:55:30,370 --> 01:55:36,390
Chaffee: as well not all that's used as energy but in any case if you if you flip that equation around

1162
01:55:36,390 --> 01:55:40,330
Chaffee: the calories don't weigh anything it doesn't matter what the calories are if you have a glass of

1163
01:55:40,330 --> 01:55:45,270
Chaffee: ice water you have a glass of of steaming hot water the steaming hot water has a lot more calories

1164
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:50,630
than the ice water they weigh the same effing thing right it's not the calories don't weigh anything

1165
01:55:50,630 --> 01:55:56,370
it's heat energy grams weigh something that's the only part of that equation that weighs anything

1166
01:55:56,370 --> 01:56:03,510
is the grams so you flip that equation around and now you're seeing one gram of fat for nine calories

1167
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:11,350
but you're seeing three grams of protein per nine calories so you have to eat three times as much

1168
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:16,890
protein in order to get two thousand calories if that's what your body requires that day right

1169
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:21,570
Chaffee: so why would you do that you're you're putting on three times the amount of weight so you can

1170
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:25,950
Chaffee: starve yourself and you can do all the other sorts of things but I think that they're not the

1171
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:34,390
best way you can do it I don't think that it's you have has your long term health intentions

1172
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:41,170
best in check if you just eat the way you're designed to eat your body's telling you how to do that

1173
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:45,510
Chaffee: your body's going you're going to lose weight this is not a race you know you're not on a

1174
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:48,850
Chaffee: game show you're not trying to you know it's not the biggest loser not trying to lose weight

1175
01:56:48,850 --> 01:56:52,950
Chaffee: faster than everybody else you're trying to be as healthy as you possibly can and part of that is

1176
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:58,410
going to be returning to a healthy body body fat percentage it will happen but the thing is is it

1177
01:56:58,410 --> 01:57:04,610
you need to be healthy first that's a primary motivation objective and it all of this is being as healthy

1178
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:09,270
as you possibly can and then the weight and musculature and all these other things they're all secondary

1179
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:15,690
they do come right but they are of secondary importance I think you do this the right way you do this

1180
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:24,170
in a as healthy a way as possible first and foremost without without you know you don't have to

1181
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:30,590
rush it will happen haste makes waste the you know the slowest steady wins the race all these

1182
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:37,110
sorts of things these things have been around for thousands of years for reason you know do it the right

1183
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:44,230
and you will get to where you want to go faster and better shape and better form then if you

1184
01:57:44,230 --> 01:57:50,190
if you try to do these other sorts of shortcuts yeah and there's a phrase called leave them one

1185
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:56,750
team more so doctor and me chafy we've come to the end and we're going to leave them one team more

1186
01:57:56,750 --> 01:58:00,210
well I thought we'd go out on a high I thought that was great Richard what did you think

1187
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:06,770
did you think that was brother good your mood you're muted buddy nobody wants to listen to me chart

1188
01:58:06,770 --> 01:58:14,050
not fantastic well appreciate as always super informative and always a pleasure so I'm yeah look

1189
01:58:14,050 --> 01:58:23,050
super looking forward to the PhD conference in May and also to our 24-hour life

1190
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:30,890
yeah definitely yeah awesome guys well it was great you both and yeah always a pleasure
